In the hierarchy of Zoroastrian DAEVAs that mirrors a similar hierarchy of divinities, Aeshma is opposed to Asha Vahishta, the Amesha Spenta, or good spirit, who embodies Truth. Aeshma’s chief adversary is Sraosha (Obedience), the principle of religious devotion and discipline. Aeshma distracts people from proper worship. He interferes with the souls of the dead as they approach the Chinvat Bridge to the underworld. The creator God, Ahura Mazda (later Ohrmazd), created Sraosha to counter Aeshma’s mischief and protect people from his attacks. Sraosha ultimately will overthrow Aeshma. In medieval texts, Aeshma is made a commander of dark forces by Angra Mainyu (later AHRIMAN). He is swallowed by AZ, the demon of avarice. Aeshma can be driven away by the recitation of a prayer from the Vendidad, a Zoroastrian text. The demon ASMODEUS of Hebrew lore may be based in part on Aeshma",

Ahriman originally was a primordial desert spirit who became the personifi cation of evil in Zoroastrianism. As such, he is not immortal, and eventually his reign of terror will be conquered by the forces of good. There are different legends about the origins of Ahriman as the evil god. In one, Ahura Mazda, the good god, created the universe and twins called Spenta Mainyu (the spirit of Light, Truth, and Life) and Angra Mainyu (the spirit of Darkness, Deceit and Death). The twins fight for supremacy and their battleground is Earth. Over time, Spenta Mainyu became absorbed into Ahura Mazda, and Angra Mainyu became Ahriman. The battle between the two forces continues and will last for thousands of years, divided into eras. After the fourth era, three saviors will appear, who will destroy Ahriman and all his forces of evil. In a variation of this legend Ahura Mazda created Angra Mainyu in a moment of doubt when he was making the universe. According to another legend, Ahriman and Ormazd (a contraction of Ahura Mazda) were twins born to Zuvan, the creator deity. Zurvan declared that the firstborn  would be supreme ruler. Ahriman ripped himself out of the womb in order to be fi rst. Zurvan was bound by his promise, but he limited the time that Ahriman could rule. At the end of that, Ormazd would take over and reign in goodness and light. The Earth is presently under the rule of Ahriman; that is why there are drought, famine, war, disease, pestilence, and other ills. To aid him in his rule, Ahriman created 99,999 diseases, and six archdemons, called Evil Mind, Tyranny, Enmity, Violence, Wrath, and Falsehood. He also created a female demon named AZ and a dragon. The archdemons struggle against the six archangel amarahspands, or “Bounteous Immortals.” Ahriman tried to maim the prophet Zarathustra but failed. A legend about Ahriman says that he had a son named Zohak, whom he trained to be evil. He told Zohak to kill his own father. He disguised himself, however, and Zohak killed someone he thought was his father. Ahriman, again in disguise, became chef of the palace. Zohak was so impressed with him that he offered to reward him. Ahriman asked only to kiss his shoulders. When he did so, SERPENTs sprang from the spots. Every time Zohak cut them off, they grew back. Ahriman entered in another disguise, as a doctor, and told Zohak that he had to feed the serpents human brains every day. Zohak complied and became Ahriman’s pride. The son ruled for a thousand years and fi nally was destroyed.",

        "description": "The DEMON of lust, The DEMON of lust, the third of the SEVEN DEADLY SINS, and of jealousy, anger, and revenge, and the 32nd of the 72 SPIRITS OF SOLOMON. Asmodeus’ chief objectives are to prevent intercourse between husband and wife, wreck new marriages, and force husbands to commit adultery. He is also one of the chief demons involved in cases of POSSESSION. Throughout history, he has been regarded as one of the most evil of SATAN’s infernal demons. He is usually portrayed as         having three heads, those of an ogre, a ram, and a bull, all sexually licentious creatures; having the feet of a cock, another sexually aggressive creature; and having wings and the tail of a SERPENT. He rides on a dragon and breathes fire. Asmodeus has his roots in ancient Persia. His name is derived from AESHMA, one of the seven archangels, or amarahspands, of Persian mythology. The Hebrews absorbed him into their mythology, where he attained the highest status and most power of all his legends. According to the Hebrews, he is the son of Naamah and Shamdon. Prior to his fall from heaven, he was part of the seraphim, the highest order of ANGELs. In other Hebrew legends, he is either associated with or the husband of LILITH, the demon queen of lust. Sometimes he is said to be the offspring of Lilith and Adam. The book of Tobit tells how Asmodeus lusted after a young woman named Sarah and killed each of her seven husbands before the marriages could be consummated. With an eighth suitor, Tobias, in her life, Sarah prayed to God for help. God sent down the archangel Raphael, who instructed Tobias in how to make an incense of the heart and liver of a glanos fi sh, which would drive away Asmodeus. After Tobias and Sarah were married, Asmodeus appeared in their wedding chamber to kill Tobias, but the incense forced him to fl ee. He went to Egypt, but Raphael tracked him down and bound him. According to the pseudepigraphical Testament of Solomon, Asmodeus lives in the constellation of the Great Bear (Ursa Major). He spreads the wickedness of men, plots against newlyweds, spreads madness about women through the stars, ruins the beauty of virgins, and commits murders. He is forever thwarted by Raphael and the smoking liver and gall of a fi sh, especially the sheatfi sh, which lives in Assyrian rivers. He has knowledge of the future. Asmodeus is taken into the presence of King SOLOMON by the Prince of Demons, BEELZEBUB. Sullen, arrogant, and defiant, he tells the king he was born of a human mother and an angel father. He also says that Solomon will have only a temporary hold over the demons; his kingdom eventually will be divided, and demons will go out again among men and will be worshipped as gods because humans will not know the names of the angels who thwart the demons. He admits that he is afraid of water. Solomon binds Asmodeus with care. He orders the demon to be fl ogged and orders him to state his activities. Asmodeus says, “I am the renowned Asmodeus; I cause the wickedness of men to spread throughout the world. I am always hatching plots against newlyweds; I mar the beauty of virgins and cause their hearts to grow cold. . . .I spread madness about women through the stars and I have often committed a rash of murders.” Solomon puts him in IRON chains and surrounds him with 10 jars full of water, which make the demon complain bitterly. Asmodeus is forced to make clay vessels for the temple. Solomon also burns the liver and gall of a fi sh and a branch of storax beneath the demon, quelling his nasty tongue. Solomon uses his magic ring to force Asmodeus and other demons to build his magnifi cent temple. After its completion, Solomon tells Asmodeus that he cannot understand why demons are so powerful when he, their leader, could be so easily chained. Asmodeus says he will prove his greatness if Solomon will remove his chains and lend him the magical ring. Solomon does so, only to be hurled far away from Jerusalem. Asmodeus steals the ring, forces Solomon into exile, and becomes king himself. He throws the ring into the sea. But Solomon’s lover, the Ammonite Namah, finds the ring in a fi sh belly, and the king regains his power. He is immediately transported to Jerusalem when he puts on the ring. As punishment, he puts Asmodeus in a jar. Asmodeus was absorbed into Christian lore, becoming one of the Devil’s leading agents of provocation. Witches were said to worship him, and magicians and sorcerers attempted to conjure him to strike out at enemies. GRIMOIRES of magical instruction sternly admonish anyone seeking an audience with Asmodeus to summon him bareheaded out of respect. JOHANN WEYER said Asmodeus rules gambling houses. According to the Lemegton, a major grimoire, Asmodeus is the “fi rst and chiefest” under AMAYMON and goes before all other demons. He gives the ring of virtues and teaches arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and all handicrafts. When properly summoned, he gives full and true answers to all questions. He can make a person invisible and will reveal all treasures under the guard of Amaymon.He was one of the infernal agents blamed for the obscene sexual possession of the Louviers nuns in 17th century France (see LOUVIERS POSSESSIONS).",

The demon is said to instigate cases of demonic POSESSION, most notably that of the Loudon nuns in France in the the 16th century.

In the Bundahisn text, Az swallows everything and anything to satisfy his want, but he is never fulfi lled. If nothing is available, he will eat his own body. Az is not the demon of death, but he brings about death through his corruption. He is behind everything disastrous that happens to human beings. Az and Ahriman will be the last demons to be defeated by the forces of light and good. In Zurvanite theology, Az leads the demonic hordes. In Manichaeism, Az is a female demon who is the mother of all demons and sin. She formed the human body and imprisoned the soul in it.

Azhi Dahaka also is described in human form with two venomous SERPENTs twining out from his neck, and as a DRUJ, half-human and half-beast. The snakes grew because either Ahriman or IBLIS kissed Azhi Dahaka there. The snakes had to be fed human brains or animal BLOOD.

It may be a corruption of Mahomet or Muhammad. The English occult historian Montague Summers suggested it was a combination of two Greek words, baphe and metis, or “absorption of knowledge.” Baphomet has also been called the Goat of Mendes, the Black Goat, and the Judas Goat. In the Middle Ages, Baphomet was believed to be an idol, represented by a human skull, a stuffed human head, or a metal or wooden human head with curly black hair. The idol was said to be worshipped by the Order of the Knights Templar as their source of fertility and wealth. The best-known representation of Baphomet is a drawing by the 19th-century French magician Eliphas Levi, called The Baphomet of Mendes. Levi combined elements of the Tarot Devil card and the he-goat worshipped in antiquity in Mendes , Egypt, which was said to fornicate with its women followers-as the church claimed the DEVIL did with witches. The Church of Satan, founded in 1966 in San Francisco, adopred a rendition of Baphomet to symbolize SATANISM. The symbol is a goat's head drawn within an inverted pentacle, enclosed in a double circle. In the outer circle, Hebraic figures at each point in the pentagram spell out LEVIATHAN, a huge water serpent demon associated with the Devil.",

        "name": "Beelzebub",
        "description": "Prince of DEMONs. Beelzebub, originally an idol of the Canaanites, means “Lord of the Flies.” The name is a distortion of Baal-zebul, the chief Canaanite or Phoenician god, meaning “Lord of the Divine Abode” or “Lord of the Heavens.” Beelzebub manifests either as a gigantic, ugly fly or as a monstrous being of great height on a giant throne. In his latter guise, he has a swollen face and chest, huge nostrils, horns, bat wings, duck feet, a lion’s tail, and a covering of thick black hair. Beelzebub has been a feared and formidable demon from the earliest accounts of him. He was the Prince of Demons in Hebrew belief at the time of JESUS. The Pharisees accused Jesus of exorcizing demons in Beelzebub’s name, for according to belief, the power to expel unclean spirits was gained through PACTs with demons. The incident is recounted in Matthew (12:24–29), Mark (3:22–27), and Luke (11:14–22): And the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said, he hath Beelzebub, and by the prince of devils casteth he out devils. And he called them unto him, and said unto them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan? And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that house cannot stand. And if Satan rise up against himself, and be divided, he cannot stand but hath an end. No man can enter into a strong man’s house, and spoil his goods, except he will fi rst bind the strong man; and then he will spoil his house. (Mark 3: 22–27) In the pseudepigraphical text the Testament of Solomon, Beelzebub, or Beelzeboul, is the Prince of Demons and is controlled by King SOLOMON with the help of his magical ring. Solomon has the demon ORNIAS fetch Beelzebub to him; Beelzebub resists but succumbs to the power of the ring. Beelzebub identifi es himself as “the ruler of all demons.” Solomon orders Beelzebub to explain the manifestation of demons, and he promises to give to the king all unclean spirits bound. He tells Solomon that he lives in the Evening Star (Venus). He alone is the Prince of Demons because he was the highest-ranking angel in heaven and is the only one left of the heavenly angels who fell. He was accompanied by another FALLEN ANGEL, ABEZETHIBOU, who was cast into the Red Sea. Abezethibou will return in triumph when he is ready, Beelzebub says. Solomon orders him to summon Abezethibou, but Beelzebub refuses to present any demon. However, he says, a demon named EPHIPPAS will appear and raise Abezethibou out of the sea. Beelzebub says he destroys tyrants, causes men to worship demons, and arouses sexual desire in holy men and “select priests.” He also causes wars, instigates murders, and arouses jealousy. He is thwarted by “the Almighty God,” Emmanuel (Jesus), and will disappear if anyone uses the oath Elo-i (my God, which Jesus cried on the cross). Solomon tells Beelzebub to cut blocks of Theban marble for the building of his temple. The other demons protest at this unfi tting task for so mighty a demon. Solomon tells Beelzebub that if he wishes his freedom, he will tell the king about other “heavenly things.” Beelzebub says that Solomon can strengthen his house by burning oil of myrrh, frankincense, sea bulbs, spikenard, and saffron and lighting seven lamps during an earthquake. Lighting the seven lamps at dawn will reveal the heavenly dragons pulling the chariot of the Sun. Solomon does not believe him and orders the demon to continue cutting marble and producing other demons for interrogation. The apochryphal text Gospel of Nicodemus describes how Beelzebub came to rule in HELL over SATAN. After the crucifi xion of JESUS, Satan bragged to Beelzebub that he was going to take Jesus to hell in revenge for all the times he had thwarted Satan. Beelzebub begged him not to do so, for Jesus was too powerful and would upset hell. Jesus arrived, and Beelzebub pushed Satan from the mouth of hell and barricaded the gate, calling upon all the demons to help him. They could not keep Jesus out. Jesus trampled over Satan and snapped the chains of the imprisoned souls with a single word. He released all the trapped saints, who went immediately to heaven. Beelzebub was powerless against him. As he left, Satan told Beelzebub, “Satan the Prince shall be subject to thy dominion forever, in the place of Adam and his righteous sons, who are Mine.” In medieval times Beelzebub was regarded as a demon of great power. He was said to reign over witches Beelzebub copulated with them. A frenzied orgy then began. When BLACK MASSES were fashionable in high society in the 17th century, Beelzebub’s name was chanted during the rites. According to magical grimoires, a sorcerer conjures Beelzebub at his own risk of death by epilepsy, apoplexy, or strangulation. Once conjured, the demon is diffi cult to banish. A conjuring spell for him is: BEELZEBUB LUCIFER MADILON SOLYMO SAROY THEU AMECLO SAGRAEL PRAREDUN VENITE BEELZEBUTH AMEN. Beelzebub also was among the demons blamed for demonic POSSESSION cases, among them NICOLE OBRY in Laon, France, in 1566, and the bewitchment of nuns in the LOUDUN POSSESSIONS and AIX-EN-PROVENCE POSSESSION in France in the late 16th and early 17th centuries, leading to the executions of his accused lieutenants, Fathers Louis Gaufridi and URBAIN GRANDIER. One of the demon’s most notorious acts was the EARLING POSSESSION, in the early 20th century in Earling, Iowa. Beelzebub entered young Anna Ecklund at the behest of her father, Jacob, in retaliation for not engaging in incestuous sex with him. The demon left on December 23, 1928, in a terrible roar of “Beelzebub, Judas, Jacob, Mina (Anna's aunt and Jacob's mistress)' followed by 'Hell, hell, hell' and terrible stench. Beezlebub rules gluttony, the fifth of the SEVEN DEADLY SINS."

Behold, his strength is in his loins, and his power in the muscles of his belly. He makes his tail stiff like a cedar; the sinews of his thighs are knit together. His bones are tubes of bronze, his limbs like bars of iron. He is the first of the works of God; let him who made him bring near his sword! For the mountains yield food for him where all the wild beasts play. Under the lotus plant he lies, in the covert of the reeds and in the marsh. For his shade the lotus trees cover him; the willows of the brooks surround him. Behold, if the river is turbulent he is not frightened; he is confi dent though Jordan rushes against his mouth. Can one take him with hooks, or pierce his nose with a snare? The verse 1 Enoch 60:7–8 a refers to Behemoth and LEVIATHAN as two monsters who will be parted at the final judgment: On that day two monsters will be parted—one monster, a female named Leviathan, in order to dwell in the abyss of the ocean over the fountains of water; and (the other) a male called Behemoth, which holds his chest in an invisible desert whose name is Dundayin, east of the garden of Eden, wherein the elect and the righteous ones dwell.

The 68th of the 72 SPIRITS OF SOLOMON, Belial is dedicated to creating wickedness and guilt in humankind, especially in the form of sexual perversions, fornication, and lust. St. Paul considered him to be chief of demons. Belial’s name may be derived from the Hebrew term beli ya’al, which means “without worth.” In Hebrew lore, Belial was the next angel created after LUCIFER and was partly of the order of angels and partly of the order of virtues. He was evil from the start, one of the fi rst to revolt against God. After his fall from heaven, he became the personification of lies and evil. Belial’s name is sometimes a synonym for SATAN or the ANTICHRIST. In the Old Testament, the phrase “sons of Belial” refers to worthlessness and recklessness. In the Testament of Solomon, a pseudepigraphical text, Belial danced before King SOLOMON and was among the demons who worked under the king’s command, ruled by Solomon’s magical ring. In the Dead Sea Scrolls, Belial is described as the leader of the Sons of Darkness, the chief of all devils, dedicated to destruction. In a Qumrun text called the Testament of Amran (Q543,  545–48), Belial is one of the WATCHERS, whose three titles are Belial, Prince of Darkness, and King of Evil. He is empowered over all darkness and his every way and every work are darkness. JOHANN WEYER said Belial commands 80 legions of demons and serves as infernal ambassador to Turkey.

He is one of the Togarini, “the wranglers.” He is an archdemon who is part of the demonic counterparts to the angels who rule the 10 sephirot of the Tree of Life; he rules over the sixth sephirah. He sits on a pierced chair, for excrement is his sacrifi cial offering. In Christian demonology, Belphegor is the incarnation of one of the SEVEN DEADLY SINS, sloth, characterized by negligence and apathy. According to St. Thomas Aquinas, all sins that arise from ignorance are caused by sloth.        Belphegor also rules misogyny and licentious men. He emerged from HELL to investigate the marital state. mong humans. For a time, he lived as a man to experience sexual pleasures.

In some cases, possession of the black book itself bestows supernatural powers, wealth, or luck upon its owner. However, use of a black book usually backfires with serious consequences. Some black books are said to be written in BLOOD as a PACT with the DEVIL. According to a German tale, a black book of unknown origin was passed down through inheritance and came into the possession of some peasants. Its magical powers were released by reading it forward and backward. If anyone failed to read the book backward, the Devil was able to take control of him or her. Once activated, the book enabled people to acquire great wealth and do terrible things to others without punishment. However, there were consequences to using the black book that caused its owners grief. They tried to get rid of the book but could not do so. They sought help from a minister, who successfully nailed the book into a drawer. Such a tale serves to demonstrate the power of Christianity over both occult powers and pagan folk magic. Black books are more than mysteriously empowered items of folklore, however. In practice, many people and families kept black books as guides for living. They included magical cures and healing recipes, prayers, CHARMs, incantations, blessings, rituals for burial, seasonal and agricultural rites, techniques for divination, and ways to ward off evil and bad luck and attract good luck. The material is a mixture of old folkways and lore and Christian elements. Some black books credit their origins to Cyprianus of Antioch (St. Cyprian), who lived in the fourth century C.E. in Turkey. According to lore, Cyprian was a sorcerer who escaped the domination of DEMONs and the Devil by making the sign of the cross. He converted to Christianity and became a bishop.

Sometimes spectral black dogs appear in the middle of lonely roads. If they are struck by a car, they disappear and the vehicle is not damaged. One famous black dog in English folklore is Black Shuck. Shuck derives from an old Anglo-Saxon term, scucca or sceocca, meaning 'demon' or 'Satan'.

        "description": "Triple-headed dog or doglike creature who guards the entrance to Hades, the Greek underworld. Not originally a “demonic” creature, Cerberus became the model for the Hellhounds of the DEVIL and other BLACK DOGS in folklore. In classical myth, Cerberus is the offspring of Typhon, a dragon and SERPENT-shaped monster associated with wind and volcanic eruptions. Typhon fathered many of the beasts of Greek legend, including Echidna, a halfwoman, half-serpent. Cerberus lives in a den on one side of the river Styx that separates the land of the living from the land of the dead. There, he greets the shades of the newly dead as they are ferried across the river by Charon. Cerberus is unpredictable in his friendliness or hostility; therefore, the dead are buried with honey cake offerings for the shades to give him, which guarantee his friendliness. As gatekeeper to the underworld, Cerberus also prevents shades from escaping. He fi gures in numerous myths of descent to the underworld, including the labors of Hercules and Orpheus’ foiled rescue attempt of his lover, Eurydice. In Homeric poems, Cerberus is “the dog.” Hades gives Hercules permission to take him up from the river Acheron provided he can quell the beast without weapons. Hercules descends accompanied by Mercury and Minerva, wrestles the dog into submission, and takes him to Eurystheus, king of Tiryns. Saliva drips from Cerberus and creates the poison aconite. Hesiod, a Greek poet ca. the eighth century B.C.E., was the fi rst writer known to have called Cerberus by a proper name. Hesiod described the beast as having 50 heads. By the time of the Roman poets, Cerberus had evolved into a three-headed dog with a dragon’s neck and tail and serpent’s heads along his back. Virgil (70–19 B.C.E.) provided the most detailed description of Cerberus in book 6 of the Aeneid, describing the underworld journey of Aeneas: Grim Cerberus, who soon began to rearHis crested snakes, and arm’d his bristling hair.The prudent Sibyl had before prepar’d Asop, in honey steep’d, to charm the guard; Which, mix’d with pow’rful drugs, she cast before His greedy grinning jaws, just op’d to roar. With three enormous mouths he gapes; and straight, With hunger press’d, devours the pleasing bait. Long draughts of sleep his monstrous limbs enslave; He reels, and, falling, fills the spacious cave.The keeper charm’d, the chief without delay Pass’d on, and took th’ irremeable way."

        "name": "Choronzon (Coronzon)",
        "description": "DEMON or spirit identified in the 16th century by John Dee and Edward Kelly, summoned in a dramatic ritual by ALEISTER CROWLEY in 1909. Dee referred to “Coronzon,” or 333, in his Enochian communications with spirits; he did not consider it to be a demon. Crowley called Choronzon the Demon of Dispersions and of the Abyss. The account of Crowley’s evocation is full of drama; it is not known whether the events happened as objective experiences or were experienced as visions. Crowley claimed to have conquered Choronzon to become a full Master of the Temple and Secret Chief. The evocation was performed in 1909. In November, Crowley and Neuberg went to Algiers on holiday and walked south through the desert to Aumale. There, Crowley was summoned by the voice of Aiwass, the entity who had dictated to him The Book of the Law, to “call Me.” He had with him the Enochian Keys of Dee and Kelly used to communicate with angels and spirits and felt he had received a divine message to use them. Crowley had successfully used the 19th Key or Call, the most difficult, to access two of the 30 aethyrs or aires (levels or planes) of expanded consciousness. He decided to access the remaining 28 aethyrs. Crowley and Neuberg went out into the desert to a mount and ascended it. To make the Call, Crowley held a vermilion-painted Calvary Cross with an engraved topaz set in its axis. The topaz was engraved with a rose of 49 petals. When his clairvoyant visions unfolded, Crowley dictated to Neuberg. They performed one aethyr a day, except for one day when they two performed. They started with the last-numbered aethyr and worked backward toward the first. Most of Crowley’s visions were apocalyptic in nature. In the 15th aethyr, he underwent an initiation to the magical grade of Master of the Temple, a title that could be fully realized only by accessing the other aethyrs. However, Crowley experienced great difficulty in trying to access the next, the 14th aethyr. After making several attempts, he stopped. He and Neuberg were on their way down the mount when Crowley suddenly was seized with the inspiration to perform a homosexual magic ritual with Neuberg and dedicate it to the Greek god of nature, Pan. They went  back to the top of the mount, inscribed in the sand a magic circle protected with names and words of power, and made a crude stone altar. Crowley took the submissive role in the sexual act as a way of eliminating ego. The ritual marked a turning point for him in his view of the importance of sex in magic; he now saw it as a benefi cial sacrament. The ritual also led to a breakthrough in consciousness, for later that evening, Crowley gained access to the 14th aethyr. In his vision, he was informed that in order to attain his cherished goal of becoming a Secret Chief and Master of the Temple, he had to undergo the complete death of his ego and unite his spirit with the ocean of infi nity. Only this way, could he cross the Abyss, the gulf that separates ordinary mortals from the Secret Chiefs. Crowley was able to resume his explorations of the other aethyrs, where he received revelation after revelation, laden with symbolism. In the 11th aethyr, he was told that in the 10th aethyr he would have to make a conscious crossing of the Abyss, inhabited by a single entity, the demon Choronzon, the “fi rst and deadliest of all the powers of evil,” a being composed of “complete negation.” The ritual for crossing the Abyss took place on December 6, 1909, outside the town of Bou Saada. Crowley and Neuberg walked out into the desert until they found a valley that had a suitable fl oor of fi ne sand. They formed a circle of rocks, drew around it a magic circle, and then drew a magic triangle. The demon would be invoked into the triangle. The circle would protect Neuberg, who would sit within it, armed with a magical knife and a notebook for recording what happened. Crowley intended to enter the triangle, a dangerous act for a magician. He thus became perhaps the first magician in the Western magical tradition to offer his own body ritually as a vehicle for manifestation of a demon. Before the start of the ritual, Neuberg took an oath that he would defend the magic circle “with thoughts and words and deeds” and would use the knife to attack anything that entered it, even Crowley. Crowley apparently was not in the triangle when he invoked the aethyr, but was in a “secret place” out of the sight and hearing of Neuberg. After the invocation, Crowley entered the triangle. To help the demon materialize, he sacrificed three pigeons at the points of the triangle and sprinkled their BLOOD. He took care not to let a drop fall outside the triangle, for that would enable Choronzon to manifest in the universe. When all the blood had soaked into the sand, he secretly recited the Call of the aethyr. He was in full trance.Neuberg records that he heard a voice, simulating Crowley’s voice, call out barbarous names and then blasphemies. Visions appeared within the triangle. First, Neuberg saw the form of a woman prostitute he had known in Paris. The “woman” tried to seduce him, but Neuberg resisted, fi guring it was Choronzon in a shape-shifted form. The “woman” then offered submission, which he also rejected. The demon next turned into an old man, then a SERPENT, and then into Crowley, who begged for water. Neuberg held fast within the circle.Neuberg ordered Choronzon to declare his nature. The demon replied that he spat upon the name of the Most High. He was Master of the Triangle, who had no fear of the pentagram. He gave Neuberg words that the magician took as “great secrets of magic” but turned out to be worthless, a joke played by the demon. Neuberg invoked Aiwass. Choronzon said that he knew the name of the angel and that “all thy dealings with him are but a cloak for thy filthy sorceries. Ordered again to declare his true nature, Choronzon said his name was Dispersion and he could not be bested in argument. He uttered a rapid string of blasphemies that taxed Neuberg’s ability to record. While distracting the magician with blasphemies, Choronzon threw sand onto the magic circle. When the outline was sufficiently blurred, he took the form of a naked man and leaped into it, throwing Neuberg to the ground. The two fought furiously. The demon tried to tear out Neuberg’s throat with his froth-covered fangs. At last, Neuberg was able to force Choronzon back into the triangle, and he repaired the magic circle. Man and demon argued. Choronzon threatened Neuberg with all the tortures of HELL, and Neuberg denounced the demon as a liar. After a long time at this, the demon suddenly vanished, leaving Crowley alone in the circle. Crowley traced the word Babalon in the sand, and the ritual was over. He and Neuberg built a fire for purification and ritually destroyed the circle and triangle.Neuberg maintained that he had literally wrestled with Choronzon, and not with Crowley possessed by the demon. Some occultists have posited that Crowley somehow exuded an ectoplasm that enabled the demon to make a form tangible enough to fi ght with Neuberg. Another explanation advanced is that the entire experience was visionary. Whatever the truth, both Crowley and Neuberg felt that Crowley had beaten the demon and achieved the status of Master of the Temple and Secret Chief. Crowley’s new vision of himself was as teacher and prophet who was to indoctrinate the world with the philosophy of The Book of the Law. Associates of Crowley said the ritual permanently damaged him and that he was possessed by Choronzon for the rest of his life."

One of his sergeants asked to change quarters because the house he was staying in had a DEMON in a “frightful form” that pestered him at night. Douglas refused the man’s request. Soon the sergeant appealed again to be moved, saying the demon had threatened his life. He said that he had awakened during the night to see the ugly form standing over him. It changed into a black cat, jumped out the window, and flew over the church steeple. The sergeant also had learned that the landlady was said to be a witch and her husband possessed “second sight” (clairvoyance). That night, Douglas spent the night beside the sergeant, with his gun and sword nearby. At midnight, he was awakened by a noise and saw a large black cat fly in through the window. He fired at it and shot off one of its ears. It vanished. The next morning, the men saw the landlady, who fainted before them in a pool of BLOOD. They discovered that one of her ears had been shot off. Douglas threatened to turn the woman in to the authorities, but she and her husband begged him to leave them alone. He agreed, on condition that they give up their “wicked ways.” It is not known whether the couple did as promised. The story is possibly a blend of fact and fi ction; the telltale wound is prominent in magical folklore in tales of shape-shifting sorcerers, witches, and werewolves."

Dumah releases all souls of the dead, not just sinners, to the Earth each evening for the first year after their deaths."

        "name": "Dybbuk",
        "description": "In Jewish demonology, an evil spirit or doomed soul that possesses a person’s body and soul, speaking through the person’s mouth and causing such torment and anguish that another personality appears to manifest itself. The term dybbuk (also spelled dibbuk) was coined in the 17th century from the language of German and Polish Jews. It is an abbreviation of two phrases: dibbuk me-ru’ah (a cleavage of an evil spirit) and dibbuk min ha-hizonim (dibbuk from the demonic side of man). Prior to the 17th century, the dybbuk was one of many evil spirits callibbur. In early folklore, dybbukim were thought only to inhabit the bodies of sick persons. Possessive evil spirits are referred to in the Old Testament. For example, Samuel I describes the possession of Saul and the way David exorcized the spirit by playing the harp. In the book of Tobit he archangel Raphael instructs Tobit in ways of EXORCISM. In the rabbinical literature of the fi rst century, exorcisms called for the ashes of a red heifer, or the roots of certain herbs, to be burned under the victim, who was then surrounded with water. Other methods included incantations in the name of King SOLOMON, repetition of the Divine Name of God, reading from Psalms, and wearing herbal AMULETs. By the 16th century, the concept of possessive evil spirits changed. Many Jews believed the spirits were transmigrated souls that could not enter a new body because of their past sins and so were forced to possess the body of a living sinner. The spirits were motivated to possess a body because they were tormented by other evil spirits if they did not. Some thought the dybbukim were the souls of people who were not properly buried and, therefore, became demons. The KABBALAH contains rituals for exorcizing a dybbuk; many are still in use in modern times. The exorcism must be performed by a ba’al shem, a miracle-working rabbi. Depending on how the exorcism is done, the dybbuk either is redeemed or is cast into HELL. It usually exits the body of its victim through the small toe, which shows a small, bloody hole as the point of departure."

        "name": "Empousai",
        "description": "In Greek lore, a type of female DEMON, related to LAMIAE and similar to the SUCCUBUS. Empousae means “forcers in.” Empusa is sometimes translated into English as “vampire.” The empousai are children of Hecate, the goddess of the underworld (see CHTHONIC DEITIES), ghosts, and magic.    They appear at her bidding at midday when people make sacrifi ces to their dead relatives. They are filthy and ugly. They have the hind ends of asses and wear brazen slippers. Sometimes they are described as having one brass leg and one ass leg. They disguise themselves as cows, bitches, or beautiful girls. In the latter form, they seduce men. They enter the human body to consume its flesh and drink its BLOOD. In The Life of Apollonius of Tyana, Philostratus relates a story—probably highly fi ctitious—about an empousa bride. Apollonius, a philosopher and wonder worker of the first century, was credited with great feats of magic and the ability to summon spirits and see the future. Philostratus’ biography draws upon the probably fictional memoirs of one of Apollonius’ disciples, Damis. The story concerns a young man of Lycia, Menippus, age 25, smart and handsome. One day as he was walking along the road to Cenchreae, he was met by an apparition—an empousa—in the guise of a Phoenician woman. He fell under her spell and fell in love with her, not realizing what she really was. They made plans to marry. Apollonius was skeptical of her. He attended the wedding and was introduced to her by Menippus. The woman acknowledged she was the owner of all the gold and silver trappings in the house and was the mistress of all the servants. Apollonius told Menippus that his bride was an empousa who would devour his fl esh and drink his blood. Menippus’ bride was offended at this and ordered Apollonius to leave, but he had broken her spell, and all the gold, silver, and servants disappeared. The woman wept and begged Apollonius not to force her to confess her true identity, but he did. She admitted that she was fattening up Menippus for a kill, and that she loved to dine on young and beautiful bodies because their blood was pure and strong. Thus, was Menippus saved from a gruesome fate. A similar tale, not quite as demonic in nature, is told by Phlegon of Tralles in Mirabilia 1, ca. 140. Philinnion is a young bride who dies and returns as a sexually hungry ghost to visit a man, Machates. Philinnion leaves behind jewelry and underwear. Machates gives her a ring and a golden cup. When the family discovers what is going on, they visit the girl’s tomb, to fi nd her bier empty, save for Machates’ gifts. The girl herself is lying in the house where Machates is a guest. A learned prophet says her corpse should be burned outside the city limits, and many sacrifices should be made to the chthonic deities. These acts are carried out, and Machates, in despair, commits suicide."

Most often, she takes three forms because she hovers near the Moon (which has three forms: waxing, full, and new). Enepsigos is conjured up as Kronos, Greek god of time. In the Testament of Solomon, Enepsigos is bound by King SOLOMON with a triple-link chain and is made to prophesy. She predicts that Solomon’s kingdom will be divided and the Temple of Jerusalem will be destroyed by the kings of the Persians, Medes, and Chaldeans. The tools in the temple will be used to serve other gods. The vessels used to trap all the demons will be broken by men, and the freed demons will go throughout the world, leading men astray until the Son of God is crucifi ed. This Son shall be born of a virgin and shall be the only one to hold power over all demons. His name is Emmanuel (Emmanouel), the letters of whose name add up to the numbers 644. Solomon does not believe Enepsigos and has her bound in unbreakable chains.

The demon appears every morning when a fresh wind starts and blows until the third hour. It kills man  and beast and cannot be contained. Adarkes asks Solomon to send someone who can control the demon. Solomon, however, forgets about the request until he has a problem with the construction of the Temple of Jerusalem. The stone that he wishes for a cornerstone is so heavy that all the artisans and demon laborers cannot move it. Solomon sends a servant out into the Arabian desert to capture the wind demon in a leather flask. The servant places Solomon’s magic ring at the neck of the flask, which is a wineskin. When the demon blows into  it and fills it up, the servant seals it closed with the ring. The local Arabs do not believe that the boy has actually contained the demon, but when the wind does not blow for three days, they become convinced. The boy presents the fl ask to Solomon inside the temple. Solomon is astonished when the fl ask has the ability to move about on its own and takes seven steps, and then falls on its neck. Speaking from inside, the demon gives his name as Ephippas and says he is thwarted by “the one    who is going to be born from a virgin and crucifi ed by the Jews” (JESUS)."

Sura 18:50 in the Qur’an states that Iblis “was one of the djinn, and he broke the command his Lord.” Like other djinn, Iblis was created by God of smokeless fire. Suras 7:12 and 38:76 refer to his creation from fire. However, the Qur’an also indicates that Iblis was treated as an angel. When Allah created Adam, he ordered all the angels to bow down and worship him. Iblis was among those who refused, claiming that a being made of dust was beneath him, a being of fi re. Allah cursed Iblis for his pride and expelled him from heaven. Iblis persuaded Allah to delay further punishment until the Day of Judgment. God gave him the right to roam the earth, tempting people, and to destroy those who yield to temptation. He cannot compel people to sin but only lure them to make the choice.

Witch hunters during the Inquisition accused witches of rewarding their imps for evil deeds by suckling them with their own BLOOD, which the imps sucked from fi ngers, warts, breasts, or any protuberance on the skin. In England the Lincoln Imp is a carved stone demon on a column in the Angel Choir at the cathedral in Lincoln, constructed in the 12th century and once the tallest structure in the world. The grinning imp is in a seated position with one leg crossed over the other. There are different versions of the legend. One version tells in rhyme that one day the Devil was in good spirits and let his young demons out to play. One rode on the wind to Lindum (Lincoln) and ordered the wind to take him into the church, intending to wreak havoc there. The imp started breaking things in the Angel Choir and was turned to stone by angels in punishment. Another version says that in the 14th century, the Devil sent two imps out to make mischief. First, they went to Chesterfi eld and twisted the spire of the church there, and then they went to Lincoln Cathedral. They tripped the bishop and smashed tables and chairs and started to destroy the Angel Choir. An angel ordered them to stop. One of the imps defi antly fl ew up to a stone pillar and began to throw heavy objects at the angel. The angel turned."

        "name": "Lilith",
        "description": "A female DEMON of the night and SUCCUBUS who flies about searching for newborn children to kidnap or strangle and sleeping men to seduce in order to produce demon children. Lilith is a major fi gure in Jewish demonology, appearing as early as 700 B.C.E. in the book of Isaiah; she or beings similar to her also are found in myths from other cultures around the world. She is the dark aspect of the Mother Goddess. She is the original “scarlet woman” and sometimes described as a screech owl, blind by day, who sucks the breasts or navels of young children or the dugs of goats. In addition to Jewish folklore, Lilith appears in various forms in Iranian, Babylonian, Sumerian, Canaanite, Persian, Arabic, Teutonic, Mexican, Greek, English, Asian, and Native American legends. She is sometimes associated with other characters in legend and myth, including the queen of Sheba and Helen of Troy. In medieval Europe, she was often portrayed as the wife, concubine, or grandmother of SATAN. Lilith appears in different guises in various texts. She is best known as the fi rst wife of Adam, created by God as twins joined in the back. Lilith demanded equality with Adam and, failing to get it, left him in anger. Adam complained to God that his wife had deserted him. God sent three angels, Sanvi, Sansanvi, and Semangelaf, to take Lilith back to Eden. The angels found her in the Red Sea and threatened her with the loss of 100 of her demon children every day unless she returned to Adam. She refused and was punished. Lilith took revenge by launching a reign of terror against women in childbirth, newborn infants—particularly males—and men who slept alone. She was forced, however, to swear to the three angels that whenever she saw their names or images on an amulet, she would leave infants and mothers alone. After the Fall, Adam spent 130 years separated from Eve, during which Lilith went to him and satisfi ed him during sleep. They had a son, who became a frog. The earliest account of Lilith appears in a midrash, Alpha Bet Ben Sira, which attempts to resolve the discrepancies in the Torah about the creation of Lilith in Genesis, followed by the creation of Eve just a few passages later. In the midrash, God created Lilith in the same way as he did Adam, but he used fi lth and impure sediment instead of dust from the earth. Adam and Lilith were at odds with each other from the beginning, and she refused to lie beneath him during intercourse. When she saw that Adam would gain power over her, she uttered the ineffable name of God and fl ew off to a cave in the desert near the Red Sea. There, as queen of Zemargad or queen of the desert, she engaged in promiscuity, including with demons, and gave birth to 100 demonic offspring called lilim every day. The daughters all practice SORCERY, seduction, and strangling. She became the bride of SAMAEL, the DEVIL (in some accounts called Ashmodai, or ASMODEUS), in a union arranged by the Blind Dragon, an entity who has been castrated so that his offspring will not overcome the world. The lilim are hairy beings, having hair everywhere on their faces and bodies except their heads. In a text preceding the Zohar, Lilith and Samael are born joined as androgynous twins from an emanation beneath the throne of glory. They are the lower aspects of another androgynous twin, Adam and Eve. In the Zohar, Lilith arises from an evil shell or husk, a KELIPPAH, that is created in the waning of the Moon. In the beginning, the Sun and Moon were equal, and this created a rivalry. To end it, God diminished the Moon and made it rule the night. Lilith’s powers are at their peak when the Moon is dark. She is the seducer of men and the strangler of children; the latter role is sometimes attributed to NAAMAH. Lilith, who has the upper body of a beautiful woman and a lower body of fire, carries the fi ery resentment of the Moon. Lilith lurks under doorways, in wells, and in latrines, waiting to seduce men. She is adorned with the “ornaments for seduction”: Her hair is long and red like the rose, her cheeks are white and red, from her ears hang six ornaments, Egyptian cords and all the ornaments of the Land of the East hang from her nape. Her mouth is set like a narrow door comely in its decor, her tongue is sharp like a sword, her words are smooth like oil, her lips are red like a rose and sweetened by all the sweetness in the world. She is dressed in scarlet and adorned with forty ornaments less one. Men who sleep alone are especially vulnerable to Lilith. The Zohar also describes Lilith as a female aspect of LEVIATHAN, who has a SERPENT body. She is Leviathan, the Tortuous Serpent, the counterpart to the male aspect, Leviathon, the Slant Serpent. Lilith is the serpent who tempts Eve with the apple of forbidden knowledge in paradise and thus instigates the Fall. She also persuades Eve to seduce Adam while she is menstruating and impure. The numerical value of Lilith’s name equals the Hebrew word for “screech.” Thus, Lilith is the “demon of screeching” and “the princess of screeching” and is personified as a screech owl. In legend, on the Day of Atonement, Lilith spends the day in a screeching battle with MAHALATH, a concubine to Samael. They taunt each other so much that the very earth trembles. Also on the Day of Atonement, Lilith goes forth into the desert with 420 LEGIONs of her demons, and they march about while she screeches. Lilith is also known as Lady of the Beasts, who rules the wilderness and all beasts, the animal side of human nature. In her guise as the queen of Sheba, she attempted to seduce King SOLOMON. He discovered her true nature by having the DJINN build a throne room with a fl oor of glass. Lilith mistook it for water and raised her garments in order to cross it to his throne. Her hairy, bestial legs were revealed in the refl ection of the glass. AMULETs and INCANTATION BOWLs traditionally protected new mothers and infants against Lilith. Common amulets were knives and hands inscribed with CHARMs; some had bells attached. Frogs also protect against her. Male infants were vulnerable for the first week of life, girls for the fi rst three weeks. Sometimes a magic circle was drawn around the lying-in bed, with a charm inscribed with the names of the three angels, Adam and Eve, and the words barring Lilith or protect this newborn child from all harm. Sometimes amulets with such inscriptions were placed in all corners of and throughout the bedchamber. If a child laughed in its sleep, it was a sign that Lilith was present. Tapping the child on the nose made the demon go away. According to lore, men who had nocturnal emissions believed they had been seduced by Lilith during the night and had to say incantations to prevent the offspring from becoming demons. Any seed spilled during sex, even marital sex, is at risk for becoming lilim."

The term loogaroo was coined by French colonists and is a corruption of the French term for werewolf, loup-garou.In order to satisfy the Devil’s demand for blood, the loogaroo preys as a vulture during the day. At night, she goes to a cottonwood tree, where she removes her own skin and hides it in the tree. She shape shifts into a blob of light and fl ies about, attacking people and animals and sucking their blood as a vampire. If the loogaroo is injured while in her shape-shifted form, she will show her wound when she changes back to human form, thus revealing her true identity. Another way of exposing her is to find her skin and grind it up with pepper and salt. This will force her to be naked in the daytime, and she will die of exposure."

        "name": "Lucifer",
        "description": "FALLEN ANGEL sometimes equated with SATAN. In Latin, Lucifer means “light bringer,” and he originally was associated with Venus, the morning star. Lucifer’s identity as a prideful angel cast out of heaven with his followers—who became DEMONs—rests mainly on legend and poetic literature, such as in the works of Dante and John Milton. The sole biblical reference to Lucifer occurs in Isaiah 14:12: “How you are fallen from heaven, O Day Star, son of Dawn!” The reference is probably to the boastful king of Babylon, a prediction of the fall of Babylon and its king. Jerome’s translation of the Bible, the Latin Vulgate, made Lucifer the chief fallen angel. His rebellion against God with the sin of pride caused him and his followers to be cast from heaven. The fallen angels lost their beauty and power and became demons. 2 Enoch, also called the Slavonic Apocalypse of Enoch, names the leader of the fallen as SATANAEL (Satanail). The text may date to the late fi rst century, although some scholars believe it to be of medieval origin, because it exists only in Slavonic. According to the text, God creates the ranks of angels on the second day of creation, shaping them out of a great fire cut off from rock. He gives them clothing of burning fl ames and fi ery weapons. He gives orders that each one should stand in his own rank. God tells the prophet Enoch: But one from the order of the archangels deviated, together with the division that was under his authority. He thought up the impossible idea, that he might place his throne higher than the clouds which are above the earth, and thus he might become equal to my power. And I hurled him out from the height, together with his angels. And he was fl ying around in the air, ceaselessly, above the Bottomless. Lucifer has received most attention in Christianity. In the early years of Christianity, the name was sometimes applied to Christ as the light bearer. The early church father Origen, who lived in the second and third centuries, equated Lucifer and Satan; later, Augustine and Jerome were among those who followed suit. By the Middle Ages, both Lucifer and Satan were used as names for the DEVIL. Lucifer could apply to the Devil in either his prefall or postfall state. Milton’s Paradise Lost and Dante’s Inferno strengthened the connection of Lucifer to Satan.In Mormonism, Lucifer (Helel in Hebrew) is a brilliant and powerful archangel, a son of Elohim (God the Father) and brother to Yahweh (God the Son, Jehovah, or Jesus) and to all of the children of Elohim including all of the souls of humanity. Lucifer became obsessed with pride and attempted to take over Elohim’s family and subvert the Father’s plan for his children. A struggle of wills ensued, and Lucifer and his followers lost. They are exiled to Earth and are permitted to tempt people. When Elohim’s purpose has been fulfi lled, Lucifer and his demonis will be exiled to the “Outer Darkness,” completely cut off from divine light and love. In the hierarchies of demons in magical lore, Lucifer s emperor of HELL and ranks above Satan, one of his lieutenants. When conjured, he appears as a beautiful child. Lucifer rules Europeans and Asiatics. In the 19th century, Leo Taxil, a Frenchman who excelled in occult hoaxes, perpetrated the fraud that Freemasonry was associated with worship of Lucifer. Although the hoax was thoroughly exposed, Taxil continues to be cited by opponents of Freemasonry Some modern occultists and satanists see Lucifer as an archangel of light who will incarnate in human form at key times to confer enlightenment and redemption."

In some tales, it becomes invisible by donning a red cap with two feathers. French immigrants to Quebec, Canada, spread lutin lore there. Lutins are fond of taking animal forms, especially pets and common animals such as rabbits, and also especially white animals. Lutins can control the weather and be either good or bad. Good lutins will perform personal services, while bad lutins will cause domestic upsets, misplace objects, and make messes. Salt spilled on the ground or fl oor will prevent lutins from crossing it"

        "name": "Malleus",
        "description": "The most influential and important witch hunter’s guide of the Inquisition. Published fi rst in Germany in 1487, the Malleus Malefi carum was translated into dozens of editions throughout Europe and England and was the leading reference for witch trials on the Continent for about 200 years. It was adopted by both Protestant and Catholic civil and ecclesiastical judges. It was second only to the Bible in sales until John Bunyan’s Pilgrim’s Progress was published in 1678. The book gives instructions for interrogating, trying, and punishing accused witches and details the nature, characteristics, and behavior of DEMONs and the DEVIL. Fourteen editions were published by 1520; another 16 editions appeared by 1669. By the end of the 17th century, there were more than 30 editions. The book became the definitive guide by which inquisitors and judges conducted themselves and that subsequent writers used as a foundation for their own works. The book was important in the way it linked witchcraft to heresy. It has been described in the centuries since as a vicious and cruel work, the most damaging book of its kind during the Inquisition. Authorship The Malleus Malefi carum is credited to the authorship of two Dominican inquisitors, Heinrich Kramer and James Sprenger, though historians now believe that it was written by Kramer, by far the more zealous of the two and one of the most zealous participants in the entire Inquisition. Kramer and Sprenger were empowered by Pope Innocent VIII in his bull of December 9, 1484, to prosecute witches throughout northern Germany. The papal edict was intended to quell Protestant opposition to the Inquisition and to solidify the case made in 1258 by Pope Alexander IV for the prosecution of witches as heretics. It was the opinion of the church that the secular arm, the civil courts, were not punishing enough witches solely on the basis of their evildoing. Both Kramer and Sprenger were prolifi c writers. Kramer, also known as Institoris, the latinized version of his name, rose to power as an inquisitor and was known to have framed some of his victims. He was violently opposed to witchcraft and seemed also to harbor hatred against women, whom he viewed as inherently weak and evil. He sought to establish a direct connection between women and diabolic witchcraft. Some historians also think that Kramer was reacting to broader sentiments of the time that were responses to the infl uences of holy women and mystics such as St. Catherine of Siena, a powerful fi gure consulted by royalty and heads of state. He did praise the saintliness of certain holy women who were able to resist the lustful temptations indulged in by witches, in his view. Sprenger was a distinguished friar, and he may have allowed Kramer to use his name in Kramer’s virulent antiwitch treatise, Apologia auctoris in Malleus Malefi carum, written by 1485. He had some association with Kramer in trials of accused witches. Kramer’s treatise was absorbed into the Malleus Malefi carum. After its publication, evidence surfaced that Kramer may have fabricated one of the offi cial letters authorizing the work. Relations between Kramer and Sprenger became strained. After Sprenger died in 1496, his colleagues attempted to distance his legacy from Kramer. Little is known about Kramer’s activities after publication of the Malleus in 1487 until his death in 1505. He remained an inquisitor. In 1500, Pope Alexander VI appointed him papal nuncio and inquisitor of Bohemia and Moravia. He was pursuing witches and heretics in Bohemia at the time of his death. Contents The Malleus is based on the biblical pronouncement “Thou shall not suffer a witch to live” (Exodus 22:18) and draws on Scripture and the works of Aristotle, St. Augustine, and St. Thomas Aquinas as support. It maintains that because God acknowledged witches, to doubt witchcraft is heresy. The book is divided into three parts and organized as questions answered by opposing arguments. Part 1 concerns how the Devil and his witches, with “the permission of Almighty God,” perpetrate a variety of evils upon men and animals, including succubi and incubi, instilling hatred, obstructing or destroying fertility, and causing the metamorphosis, or shape shifting, of human beings into beasts. God permits these acts; otherwise, the Devil would have unlimited power and destroy the world. Part 2 describes how witches cast spells and bewitchments and do their evil and how these actions can be prevented or remedied. Particular emphasis is given to Devil’s PACTs, a key to proving heresy. The existence of witches and their malefi cia is treated as unassailable fact, and wild stories of SABBATs and other abominations are presented as truth. Most of the stories are from the inquisitions conducted by Sprenger and Kramer and from material of other ecclesiastical witchcraft writers. Part 3 sets forth the legal procedures for trying witches, including the taking of testimony, admission of evidence, methods of interrogation and torture, and guidelines for sentencing. Judges are instructed to allow hostile witnesses because everyone hates witches. Torture is to be applied if the accused do not confess voluntarily. Judges are permitted to lie to the accused, promising them mercy if they confess, a tactic readily employed by Kramer. This, the text argues, is all done in the best interest of society and the state. The Malleus allows for light sentences of penance and imprisonment in certain cases but urges execution of as many witches as possible. Most of the instructions on sentencing pertain to death. Some questions are not answered clearly and contradictions abound. For example, the authors say that the Devil, through witches, mainly affl icts good and just people, then says only the wicked are vulnerable. At one point, judges are said to be immune to the bewitchments of witches; at another, witches cast spells over judges with the glance of an eye, and judges are admonished to protect themselves with salt and sacraments. The Malleus Malefi carum was refuted by JOHANN WEYER."

According to lore, Mastema once was the Angel of the Lord who delivered the punishments of the Lord and became demonized. In 10 references in Qumran texts, Mastema is equated with BELIAL, whose purpose is to destroy. He also is described as existing between the Prince of Light and the Angel of Darkness and ruling the children of falsehood. He leads the children of righteousness astray. In Jubilees, Mastema is the only angel named and is equated with the Angel of Hostility. His origins are not explained, though he is equated with SATAN and is the prince of evil beings who menace and harass humankind. As a SATAN, Mastema urges God to test Abraham with the sacrifi ce of his son, Isaac. Mastema also aids the Egyptians in opposition to Moses and tries to kill him. He helps the pharaoh’s magicians compete with Moses and Aaron. His demons lead the sons of Noah astray to commit sin, idolatry, and pollution. One legend holds that Mastema asked God to give him some demons so that he might have power over humankind; God gave him one-tenth of the fallen ones to be under his command."
