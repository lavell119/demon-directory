He has seven powers that he can use for the destruction of humanity. In the hierarchy of Zoroastrian DAEVAs that mirrors a similar hierarchy of divinities, Aeshma is opposed to Asha Vahishta, the Amesha Spenta, or good spirit, who embodies Truth. Aeshma’s chief adversary is Sraosha (Obedience), the principle of religious devotion and discipline. Aeshma distracts people from proper worship. He interferes with the souls of the dead as they approach the Chinvat Bridge to the underworld. The creator God, Ahura Mazda (later Ohrmazd), created Sraosha to counter Aeshma’s mischief and protect people from his attacks. Sraosha ultimately will overthrow Aeshma. In medieval texts, Aeshma is made a commander of dark forces by Angra Mainyu (later AHRIMAN). He is swallowed by AZ, the demon of avarice. Aeshma can be driven away by the recitation of a prayer from the Vendidad, a Zoroastrian text. The demon ASMODEUS of Hebrew lore may be based in part on Aeshma",

Ahriman originally was a primordial desert spirit who became the personifi cation of evil in Zoroastrianism. As such, he is not immortal, and eventually his reign of terror will be conquered by the forces of good. There are different legends about the origins of Ahriman as the evil god. In one, Ahura Mazda, the good god, created the universe and twins called Spenta Mainyu (the spirit of Light, Truth, and Life) and Angra Mainyu (the spirit of Darkness, Deceit and Death). The twins fight for supremacy and their battleground is Earth. Over time, Spenta Mainyu became absorbed into Ahura Mazda, and Angra Mainyu became Ahriman. The battle between the two forces continues and will last for thousands of years, divided into eras. After the fourth era, three saviors will appear, who will destroy Ahriman and all his forces of evil. In a variation of this legend Ahura Mazda created Angra Mainyu in a moment of doubt when he was making the universe. According to another legend, Ahriman and Ormazd (a contraction of Ahura Mazda) were twins born to Zuvan, the creator deity. Zurvan declared that the firstborn  would be supreme ruler. Ahriman ripped himself out of the womb in order to be fi rst. Zurvan was bound by his promise, but he limited the time that Ahriman could rule. At the end of that, Ormazd would take over and reign in goodness and light. The Earth is presently under the rule of Ahriman; that is why there are drought, famine, war, disease, pestilence, and other ills. To aid him in his rule, Ahriman created 99,999 diseases, and six archdemons, called Evil Mind, Tyranny, Enmity, Violence, Wrath, and Falsehood. He also created a female demon named AZ and a dragon. The archdemons struggle against the six archangel amarahspands, or “Bounteous Immortals.” Ahriman tried to maim the prophet Zarathustra but failed. A legend about Ahriman says that he had a son named Zohak, whom he trained to be evil. He told Zohak to kill his own father. He disguised himself, however, and Zohak killed someone he thought was his father. Ahriman, again in disguise, became chef of the palace. Zohak was so impressed with him that he offered to reward him. Ahriman asked only to kiss his shoulders. When he did so, SERPENTs sprang from the spots. Every time Zohak cut them off, they grew back. Ahriman entered in another disguise, as a doctor, and told Zohak that he had to feed the serpents human brains every day. Zohak complied and became Ahriman’s pride. The son ruled for a thousand years and fi nally was destroyed.",

The alp can assume different forms, from seductive humans to animals, such as cats, pigs, birds, and lecherous dogs. It may be disguised as a butterfly released by the breath of the horerczy, another vampiric demon. Regardless of its form, the alp likes to wear a magical hat, which confers upon it invisibility and supernatural power, including the EVIL EYE. The alp has an odd way of sexually molesting men and  women: It enters through the victim’s mouth as a mist or a SERPENT. It drinks BLOOD through the nipples of both men and women and consumes the milk of women and cows. It sucks the life breath from victims. Folklore holds that women can prevent the alp from bothering them at night by sleeping with their shoes at the side of the bed and pointing toward the door",
