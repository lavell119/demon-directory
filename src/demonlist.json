In the hierarchy of Zoroastrian DAEVAs that mirrors a similar hierarchy of divinities, Aeshma is opposed to Asha Vahishta, the Amesha Spenta, or good spirit, who embodies Truth. Aeshma’s chief adversary is Sraosha (Obedience), the principle of religious devotion and discipline. Aeshma distracts people from proper worship. He interferes with the souls of the dead as they approach the Chinvat Bridge to the underworld. The creator God, Ahura Mazda (later Ohrmazd), created Sraosha to counter Aeshma’s mischief and protect people from his attacks. Sraosha ultimately will overthrow Aeshma. In medieval texts, Aeshma is made a commander of dark forces by Angra Mainyu (later AHRIMAN). He is swallowed by AZ, the demon of avarice. Aeshma can be driven away by the recitation of a prayer from the Vendidad, a Zoroastrian text. The demon ASMODEUS of Hebrew lore may be based in part on Aeshma",

Ahriman originally was a primordial desert spirit who became the personifi cation of evil in Zoroastrianism. As such, he is not immortal, and eventually his reign of terror will be conquered by the forces of good. There are different legends about the origins of Ahriman as the evil god. In one, Ahura Mazda, the good god, created the universe and twins called Spenta Mainyu (the spirit of Light, Truth, and Life) and Angra Mainyu (the spirit of Darkness, Deceit and Death). The twins fight for supremacy and their battleground is Earth. Over time, Spenta Mainyu became absorbed into Ahura Mazda, and Angra Mainyu became Ahriman. The battle between the two forces continues and will last for thousands of years, divided into eras. After the fourth era, three saviors will appear, who will destroy Ahriman and all his forces of evil. In a variation of this legend Ahura Mazda created Angra Mainyu in a moment of doubt when he was making the universe. According to another legend, Ahriman and Ormazd (a contraction of Ahura Mazda) were twins born to Zuvan, the creator deity. Zurvan declared that the firstborn  would be supreme ruler. Ahriman ripped himself out of the womb in order to be fi rst. Zurvan was bound by his promise, but he limited the time that Ahriman could rule. At the end of that, Ormazd would take over and reign in goodness and light. The Earth is presently under the rule of Ahriman; that is why there are drought, famine, war, disease, pestilence, and other ills. To aid him in his rule, Ahriman created 99,999 diseases, and six archdemons, called Evil Mind, Tyranny, Enmity, Violence, Wrath, and Falsehood. He also created a female demon named AZ and a dragon. The archdemons struggle against the six archangel amarahspands, or “Bounteous Immortals.” Ahriman tried to maim the prophet Zarathustra but failed. A legend about Ahriman says that he had a son named Zohak, whom he trained to be evil. He told Zohak to kill his own father. He disguised himself, however, and Zohak killed someone he thought was his father. Ahriman, again in disguise, became chef of the palace. Zohak was so impressed with him that he offered to reward him. Ahriman asked only to kiss his shoulders. When he did so, SERPENTs sprang from the spots. Every time Zohak cut them off, they grew back. Ahriman entered in another disguise, as a doctor, and told Zohak that he had to feed the serpents human brains every day. Zohak complied and became Ahriman’s pride. The son ruled for a thousand years and fi nally was destroyed.",

        "description": "The DEMON of lust, The DEMON of lust, the third of the SEVEN DEADLY SINS, and of jealousy, anger, and revenge, and the 32nd of the 72 SPIRITS OF SOLOMON. Asmodeus’ chief objectives are to prevent intercourse between husband and wife, wreck new marriages, and force husbands to commit adultery. He is also one of the chief demons involved in cases of POSSESSION. Throughout history, he has been regarded as one of the most evil of SATAN’s infernal demons. He is usually portrayed as         having three heads, those of an ogre, a ram, and a bull, all sexually licentious creatures; having the feet of a cock, another sexually aggressive creature; and having wings and the tail of a SERPENT. He rides on a dragon and breathes fire. Asmodeus has his roots in ancient Persia. His name is derived from AESHMA, one of the seven archangels, or amarahspands, of Persian mythology. The Hebrews absorbed him into their mythology, where he attained the highest status and most power of all his legends. According to the Hebrews, he is the son of Naamah and Shamdon. Prior to his fall from heaven, he was part of the seraphim, the highest order of ANGELs. In other Hebrew legends, he is either associated with or the husband of LILITH, the demon queen of lust. Sometimes he is said to be the offspring of Lilith and Adam. The book of Tobit tells how Asmodeus lusted after a young woman named Sarah and killed each of her seven husbands before the marriages could be consummated. With an eighth suitor, Tobias, in her life, Sarah prayed to God for help. God sent down the archangel Raphael, who instructed Tobias in how to make an incense of the heart and liver of a glanos fi sh, which would drive away Asmodeus. After Tobias and Sarah were married, Asmodeus appeared in their wedding chamber to kill Tobias, but the incense forced him to fl ee. He went to Egypt, but Raphael tracked him down and bound him. According to the pseudepigraphical Testament of Solomon, Asmodeus lives in the constellation of the Great Bear (Ursa Major). He spreads the wickedness of men, plots against newlyweds, spreads madness about women through the stars, ruins the beauty of virgins, and commits murders. He is forever thwarted by Raphael and the smoking liver and gall of a fi sh, especially the sheatfi sh, which lives in Assyrian rivers. He has knowledge of the future. Asmodeus is taken into the presence of King SOLOMON by the Prince of Demons, BEELZEBUB. Sullen, arrogant, and defiant, he tells the king he was born of a human mother and an angel father. He also says that Solomon will have only a temporary hold over the demons; his kingdom eventually will be divided, and demons will go out again among men and will be worshipped as gods because humans will not know the names of the angels who thwart the demons. He admits that he is afraid of water. Solomon binds Asmodeus with care. He orders the demon to be fl ogged and orders him to state his activities. Asmodeus says, “I am the renowned Asmodeus; I cause the wickedness of men to spread throughout the world. I am always hatching plots against newlyweds; I mar the beauty of virgins and cause their hearts to grow cold. . . .I spread madness about women through the stars and I have often committed a rash of murders.” Solomon puts him in IRON chains and surrounds him with 10 jars full of water, which make the demon complain bitterly. Asmodeus is forced to make clay vessels for the temple. Solomon also burns the liver and gall of a fi sh and a branch of storax beneath the demon, quelling his nasty tongue. Solomon uses his magic ring to force Asmodeus and other demons to build his magnifi cent temple. After its completion, Solomon tells Asmodeus that he cannot understand why demons are so powerful when he, their leader, could be so easily chained. Asmodeus says he will prove his greatness if Solomon will remove his chains and lend him the magical ring. Solomon does so, only to be hurled far away from Jerusalem. Asmodeus steals the ring, forces Solomon into exile, and becomes king himself. He throws the ring into the sea. But Solomon’s lover, the Ammonite Namah, finds the ring in a fi sh belly, and the king regains his power. He is immediately transported to Jerusalem when he puts on the ring. As punishment, he puts Asmodeus in a jar. Asmodeus was absorbed into Christian lore, becoming one of the Devil’s leading agents of provocation. Witches were said to worship him, and magicians and sorcerers attempted to conjure him to strike out at enemies. GRIMOIRES of magical instruction sternly admonish anyone seeking an audience with Asmodeus to summon him bareheaded out of respect. JOHANN WEYER said Asmodeus rules gambling houses. According to the Lemegton, a major grimoire, Asmodeus is the “fi rst and chiefest” under AMAYMON and goes before all other demons. He gives the ring of virtues and teaches arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and all handicrafts. When properly summoned, he gives full and true answers to all questions. He can make a person invisible and will reveal all treasures under the guard of Amaymon.He was one of the infernal agents blamed for the obscene sexual possession of the Louviers nuns in 17th century France (see LOUVIERS POSSESSIONS).",

The snakes grew because either Ahriman or IBLIS kissed Azhi Dahaka there. The snakes had to be fed human brains or animal BLOOD. In Babylonian lore, he was the king of Babel and had a human shape with serpents in his neck. Azhi Dahaka governs storms and storm clouds and causes drought and disease. He eats cattle. In lore, he turned to eating humans, even the first one created, King Yima. Hu usurps Yima and rules for 1000 years until he is vanquished by the Persian king Fereydun. The demon will destroy one-third of the world until he is stopped by Keresapa. In Persian lore, the Persian king Fereydun (Thraetona) binds him in chains under the Mount Davand by the Caspian Sea until the end of time. In another version, Azhi Dahaka is chained to a rock in the sun until he dies.",

The crops withered, until Baal’s sister, Anath, the maiden goddess of love, found his body and gave it proper burial. The Canaanites worshipped Baal by sacrifi cing children by burning.

It may be a corruption of Mahomet or Muhammad. The English occult historian Montague Summers suggested it was a combination of two Greek words, baphe and metis, or “absorption of knowledge.” Baphomet has also been called the Goat of Mendes, the Black Goat, and the Judas Goat. In the Middle Ages, Baphomet was believed to be an idol, represented by a human skull, a stuffed human head, or a metal or wooden human head with curly black hair. The idol was said to be worshipped by the Order of the Knights Templar as their source of fertility and wealth. The best-known representation of Baphomet is a drawing by the 19th-century French magician Eliphas Levi, called The Baphomet of Mendes. Levi combined elements of the Tarot Devil card and the he-goat worshipped in antiquity in Mendes , Egypt, which was said to fornicate with its women followers-as the church claimed the DEVIL did with witches. The Church of Satan, founded in 1966 in San Francisco, adopred a rendition of Baphomet to symbolize SATANISM. The symbol is a goat's head drawn within an inverted pentacle, enclosed in a double circle. In the outer circle, Hebraic figures at each point in the pentagram spell out LEVIATHAN, a huge water serpent demon associated with the Devil.",

        "name": "Beelzebub",
        "description": "Prince of DEMONs. Beelzebub, originally an idol of the Canaanites, means “Lord of the Flies.” The name is a distortion of Baal-zebul, the chief Canaanite or Phoenician god, meaning “Lord of the Divine Abode” or “Lord of the Heavens.” Beelzebub manifests either as a gigantic, ugly fly or as a monstrous being of great height on a giant throne. In his latter guise, he has a swollen face and chest, huge nostrils, horns, bat wings, duck feet, a lion’s tail, and a covering of thick black hair. Beelzebub has been a feared and formidable demon from the earliest accounts of him. He was the Prince of Demons in Hebrew belief at the time of JESUS. The Pharisees accused Jesus of exorcizing demons in Beelzebub’s name, for according to belief, the power to expel unclean spirits was gained through PACTs with demons. The incident is recounted in Matthew (12:24–29), Mark (3:22–27), and Luke (11:14–22): And the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said, he hath Beelzebub, and by the prince of devils casteth he out devils. And he called them unto him, and said unto them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan? And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that house cannot stand. And if Satan rise up against himself, and be divided, he cannot stand but hath an end. No man can enter into a strong man’s house, and spoil his goods, except he will fi rst bind the strong man; and then he will spoil his house. (Mark 3: 22–27) In the pseudepigraphical text the Testament of Solomon, Beelzebub, or Beelzeboul, is the Prince of Demons and is controlled by King SOLOMON with the help of his magical ring. Solomon has the demon ORNIAS fetch Beelzebub to him; Beelzebub resists but succumbs to the power of the ring. Beelzebub identifi es himself as “the ruler of all demons.” Solomon orders Beelzebub to explain the manifestation of demons, and he promises to give to the king all unclean spirits bound. He tells Solomon that he lives in the Evening Star (Venus). He alone is the Prince of Demons because he was the highest-ranking angel in heaven and is the only one left of the heavenly angels who fell. He was accompanied by another FALLEN ANGEL, ABEZETHIBOU, who was cast into the Red Sea. Abezethibou will return in triumph when he is ready, Beelzebub says. Solomon orders him to summon Abezethibou, but Beelzebub refuses to present any demon. However, he says, a demon named EPHIPPAS will appear and raise Abezethibou out of the sea. Beelzebub says he destroys tyrants, causes men to worship demons, and arouses sexual desire in holy men and “select priests.” He also causes wars, instigates murders, and arouses jealousy. He is thwarted by “the Almighty God,” Emmanuel (Jesus), and will disappear if anyone uses the oath Elo-i (my God, which Jesus cried on the cross). Solomon tells Beelzebub to cut blocks of Theban marble for the building of his temple. The other demons protest at this unfi tting task for so mighty a demon. Solomon tells Beelzebub that if he wishes his freedom, he will tell the king about other “heavenly things.” Beelzebub says that Solomon can strengthen his house by burning oil of myrrh, frankincense, sea bulbs, spikenard, and saffron and lighting seven lamps during an earthquake. Lighting the seven lamps at dawn will reveal the heavenly dragons pulling the chariot of the Sun. Solomon does not believe him and orders the demon to continue cutting marble and producing other demons for interrogation. The apochryphal text Gospel of Nicodemus describes how Beelzebub came to rule in HELL over SATAN. After the crucifi xion of JESUS, Satan bragged to Beelzebub that he was going to take Jesus to hell in revenge for all the times he had thwarted Satan. Beelzebub begged him not to do so, for Jesus was too powerful and would upset hell. Jesus arrived, and Beelzebub pushed Satan from the mouth of hell and barricaded the gate, calling upon all the demons to help him. They could not keep Jesus out. Jesus trampled over Satan and snapped the chains of the imprisoned souls with a single word. He released all the trapped saints, who went immediately to heaven. Beelzebub was powerless against him. As he left, Satan told Beelzebub, “Satan the Prince shall be subject to thy dominion forever, in the place of Adam and his righteous sons, who are Mine.” In medieval times Beelzebub was regarded as a demon of great power. He was said to reign over witches Beelzebub copulated with them. A frenzied orgy then began. When BLACK MASSES were fashionable in high society in the 17th century, Beelzebub’s name was chanted during the rites. According to magical grimoires, a sorcerer conjures Beelzebub at his own risk of death by epilepsy, apoplexy, or strangulation. Once conjured, the demon is diffi cult to banish. A conjuring spell for him is: BEELZEBUB LUCIFER MADILON SOLYMO SAROY THEU AMECLO SAGRAEL PRAREDUN VENITE BEELZEBUTH AMEN. Beelzebub also was among the demons blamed for demonic POSSESSION cases, among them NICOLE OBRY in Laon, France, in 1566, and the bewitchment of nuns in the LOUDUN POSSESSIONS and AIX-EN-PROVENCE POSSESSION in France in the late 16th and early 17th centuries, leading to the executions of his accused lieutenants, Fathers Louis Gaufridi and URBAIN GRANDIER. One of the demon’s most notorious acts was the EARLING POSSESSION, in the early 20th century in Earling, Iowa. Beelzebub entered young Anna Ecklund at the behest of her father, Jacob, in retaliation for not engaging in incestuous sex with him. The demon left on December 23, 1928, in a terrible roar of “Beelzebub, Judas, Jacob, Mina (Anna's aunt and Jacob's mistress)' followed by 'Hell, hell, hell' and terrible stench. Beezlebub rules gluttony, the fifth of the SEVEN DEADLY SINS.",

Behold, his strength is in his loins, and his power in the muscles of his belly. He makes his tail stiff like a cedar; the sinews of his thighs are knit together. His bones are tubes of bronze, his limbs like bars of iron. He is the first of the works of God; let him who made him bring near his sword! For the mountains yield food for him where all the wild beasts play. Under the lotus plant he lies, in the covert of the reeds and in the marsh. For his shade the lotus trees cover him; the willows of the brooks surround him. Behold, if the river is turbulent he is not frightened; he is confi dent though Jordan rushes against his mouth. Can one take him with hooks, or pierce his nose with a snare? The verse 1 Enoch 60:7–8 a refers to Behemoth and LEVIATHAN as two monsters who will be parted at the final judgment: On that day two monsters will be parted—one monster, a female named Leviathan, in order to dwell in the abyss of the ocean over the fountains of water; and (the other) a male called Behemoth, which holds his chest in an invisible desert whose name is Dundayin, east of the garden of Eden, wherein the elect and the righteous ones dwell.

The 68th of the 72 SPIRITS OF SOLOMON, Belial is dedicated to creating wickedness and guilt in humankind, especially in the form of sexual perversions, fornication, and lust. St. Paul considered him to be chief of demons. Belial’s name may be derived from the Hebrew term beli ya’al, which means “without worth.” In Hebrew lore, Belial was the next angel created after LUCIFER and was partly of the order of angels and partly of the order of virtues. He was evil from the start, one of the fi rst to revolt against God. After his fall from heaven, he became the personification of lies and evil. Belial’s name is sometimes a synonym for SATAN or the ANTICHRIST. In the Old Testament, the phrase “sons of Belial” refers to worthlessness and recklessness. In the Testament of Solomon, a pseudepigraphical text, Belial danced before King SOLOMON and was among the demons who worked under the king’s command, ruled by Solomon’s magical ring. In the Dead Sea Scrolls, Belial is described as the leader of the Sons of Darkness, the chief of all devils, dedicated to destruction. In a Qumrun text called the Testament of Amran (Q543,  545–48), Belial is one of the WATCHERS, whose three titles are Belial, Prince of Darkness, and King of Evil. He is empowered over all darkness and his every way and every work are darkness. JOHANN WEYER said Belial commands 80 legions of demons and serves as infernal ambassador to Turkey.

In Christian demonology, Belphegor is the incarnation of one of the SEVEN DEADLY SINS, sloth, characterized by negligence and apathy. According to St. Thomas Aquinas, all sins that arise from ignorance are caused by sloth. Belphegor also rules misogyny and licentious men. He emerged from HELL to investigate the marital state. mong humans. For a time, he lived as a man to experience sexual pleasures.

        "description": "Triple-headed dog or doglike creature who guards the entrance to Hades, the Greek underworld. Not originally a “demonic” creature, Cerberus became the model for the Hellhounds of the DEVIL and other BLACK DOGS in folklore. In classical myth, Cerberus is the offspring of Typhon, a dragon and SERPENT-shaped monster associated with wind and volcanic eruptions. Typhon fathered many of the beasts of Greek legend, including Echidna, a halfwoman, half-serpent. Cerberus lives in a den on one side of the river Styx that separates the land of the living from the land of the dead. There, he greets the shades of the newly dead as they are ferried across the river by Charon. Cerberus is unpredictable in his friendliness or hostility; therefore, the dead are buried with honey cake offerings for the shades to give him, which guarantee his friendliness. As gatekeeper to the underworld, Cerberus also prevents shades from escaping. He fi gures in numerous myths of descent to the underworld, including the labors of Hercules and Orpheus’ foiled rescue attempt of his lover, Eurydice. In Homeric poems, Cerberus is “the dog.” Hades gives Hercules permission to take him up from the river Acheron provided he can quell the beast without weapons. Hercules descends accompanied by Mercury and Minerva, wrestles the dog into submission, and takes him to Eurystheus, king of Tiryns. Saliva drips from Cerberus and creates the poison aconite. Hesiod, a Greek poet ca. the eighth century B.C.E., was the fi rst writer known to have called Cerberus by a proper name. Hesiod described the beast as having 50 heads. By the time of the Roman poets, Cerberus had evolved into a three-headed dog with a dragon’s neck and tail and serpent’s heads along his back. Virgil (70–19 B.C.E.) provided the most detailed description of Cerberus in book 6 of the Aeneid, describing the underworld journey of Aeneas: Grim Cerberus, who soon began to rearHis crested snakes, and arm’d his bristling hair.The prudent Sibyl had before prepar’d Asop, in honey steep’d, to charm the guard; Which, mix’d with pow’rful drugs, she cast before His greedy grinning jaws, just op’d to roar. With three enormous mouths he gapes; and straight, With hunger press’d, devours the pleasing bait. Long draughts of sleep his monstrous limbs enslave; He reels, and, falling, fills the spacious cave.The keeper charm’d, the chief without delay Pass’d on, and took th’ irremeable way.",

        "name": "Choronzon (Coronzon)",
        "description": "DEMON or spirit identified in the 16th century by John Dee and Edward Kelly, summoned in a dramatic ritual by ALEISTER CROWLEY in 1909. Dee referred to “Coronzon,” or 333, in his Enochian communications with spirits; he did not consider it to be a demon. Crowley called Choronzon the Demon of Dispersions and of the Abyss. The account of Crowley’s evocation is full of drama; it is not known whether the events happened as objective experiences or were experienced as visions. Crowley claimed to have conquered Choronzon to become a full Master of the Temple and Secret Chief. The evocation was performed in 1909. In November, Crowley and Neuberg went to Algiers on holiday and walked south through the desert to Aumale. There, Crowley was summoned by the voice of Aiwass, the entity who had dictated to him The Book of the Law, to “call Me.” He had with him the Enochian Keys of Dee and Kelly used to communicate with angels and spirits and felt he had received a divine message to use them. Crowley had successfully used the 19th Key or Call, the most difficult, to access two of the 30 aethyrs or aires (levels or planes) of expanded consciousness. He decided to access the remaining 28 aethyrs. Crowley and Neuberg went out into the desert to a mount and ascended it. To make the Call, Crowley held a vermilion-painted Calvary Cross with an engraved topaz set in its axis. The topaz was engraved with a rose of 49 petals. When his clairvoyant visions unfolded, Crowley dictated to Neuberg. They performed one aethyr a day, except for one day when they two performed. They started with the last-numbered aethyr and worked backward toward the first. Most of Crowley’s visions were apocalyptic in nature. In the 15th aethyr, he underwent an initiation to the magical grade of Master of the Temple, a title that could be fully realized only by accessing the other aethyrs. However, Crowley experienced great difficulty in trying to access the next, the 14th aethyr. After making several attempts, he stopped. He and Neuberg were on their way down the mount when Crowley suddenly was seized with the inspiration to perform a homosexual magic ritual with Neuberg and dedicate it to the Greek god of nature, Pan. They went  back to the top of the mount, inscribed in the sand a magic circle protected with names and words of power, and made a crude stone altar. Crowley took the submissive role in the sexual act as a way of eliminating ego. The ritual marked a turning point for him in his view of the importance of sex in magic; he now saw it as a benefi cial sacrament. The ritual also led to a breakthrough in consciousness, for later that evening, Crowley gained access to the 14th aethyr. In his vision, he was informed that in order to attain his cherished goal of becoming a Secret Chief and Master of the Temple, he had to undergo the complete death of his ego and unite his spirit with the ocean of infi nity. Only this way, could he cross the Abyss, the gulf that separates ordinary mortals from the Secret Chiefs. Crowley was able to resume his explorations of the other aethyrs, where he received revelation after revelation, laden with symbolism. In the 11th aethyr, he was told that in the 10th aethyr he would have to make a conscious crossing of the Abyss, inhabited by a single entity, the demon Choronzon, the “fi rst and deadliest of all the powers of evil,” a being composed of “complete negation.” The ritual for crossing the Abyss took place on December 6, 1909, outside the town of Bou Saada. Crowley and Neuberg walked out into the desert until they found a valley that had a suitable fl oor of fi ne sand. They formed a circle of rocks, drew around it a magic circle, and then drew a magic triangle. The demon would be invoked into the triangle. The circle would protect Neuberg, who would sit within it, armed with a magical knife and a notebook for recording what happened. Crowley intended to enter the triangle, a dangerous act for a magician. He thus became perhaps the first magician in the Western magical tradition to offer his own body ritually as a vehicle for manifestation of a demon. Before the start of the ritual, Neuberg took an oath that he would defend the magic circle “with thoughts and words and deeds” and would use the knife to attack anything that entered it, even Crowley. Crowley apparently was not in the triangle when he invoked the aethyr, but was in a “secret place” out of the sight and hearing of Neuberg. After the invocation, Crowley entered the triangle. To help the demon materialize, he sacrificed three pigeons at the points of the triangle and sprinkled their BLOOD. He took care not to let a drop fall outside the triangle, for that would enable Choronzon to manifest in the universe. When all the blood had soaked into the sand, he secretly recited the Call of the aethyr. He was in full trance.Neuberg records that he heard a voice, simulating Crowley’s voice, call out barbarous names and then blasphemies. Visions appeared within the triangle. First, Neuberg saw the form of a woman prostitute he had known in Paris. The “woman” tried to seduce him, but Neuberg resisted, fi guring it was Choronzon in a shape-shifted form. The “woman” then offered submission, which he also rejected. The demon next turned into an old man, then a SERPENT, and then into Crowley, who begged for water. Neuberg held fast within the circle.Neuberg ordered Choronzon to declare his nature. The demon replied that he spat upon the name of the Most High. He was Master of the Triangle, who had no fear of the pentagram. He gave Neuberg words that the magician took as “great secrets of magic” but turned out to be worthless, a joke played by the demon. Neuberg invoked Aiwass. Choronzon said that he knew the name of the angel and that “all thy dealings with him are but a cloak for thy filthy sorceries. Ordered again to declare his true nature, Choronzon said his name was Dispersion and he could not be bested in argument. He uttered a rapid string of blasphemies that taxed Neuberg’s ability to record. While distracting the magician with blasphemies, Choronzon threw sand onto the magic circle. When the outline was sufficiently blurred, he took the form of a naked man and leaped into it, throwing Neuberg to the ground. The two fought furiously. The demon tried to tear out Neuberg’s throat with his froth-covered fangs. At last, Neuberg was able to force Choronzon back into the triangle, and he repaired the magic circle. Man and demon argued. Choronzon threatened Neuberg with all the tortures of HELL, and Neuberg denounced the demon as a liar. After a long time at this, the demon suddenly vanished, leaving Crowley alone in the circle. Crowley traced the word Babalon in the sand, and the ritual was over. He and Neuberg built a fire for purification and ritually destroyed the circle and triangle.Neuberg maintained that he had literally wrestled with Choronzon, and not with Crowley possessed by the demon. Some occultists have posited that Crowley somehow exuded an ectoplasm that enabled the demon to make a form tangible enough to fi ght with Neuberg. Another explanation advanced is that the entire experience was visionary. Whatever the truth, both Crowley and Neuberg felt that Crowley had beaten the demon and achieved the status of Master of the Temple and Secret Chief. Crowley’s new vision of himself was as teacher and prophet who was to indoctrinate the world with the philosophy of The Book of the Law. Associates of Crowley said the ritual permanently damaged him and that he was possessed by Choronzon for the rest of his life.",

They personify all diseases, sins, and distresses suffered by humanity. Most of the daevas are male. In the Gathas, the oldest Zoroastrian texts, the daevas are wrong or false gods, or “gods that are (to be) rejected.” In the Younger Avesta, the daevas are vile beings who create chaos and disorder. In later tradition and folklore, they personify all evils imaginable. The daevas were created from the evil thoughts of AHRIMAN for the purpose of waging war against goodness and humanity. Though spirits, they can appear in human form. Evil men also are called daevas. When the prophet Zoroaster was born, the daevas went into hiding beneath the earth. They lurk about, ready to attack the vulnerable. They are attracted to unclean places and like to spend time in locations where corpses are exposed. The daevas originate in the north, the direction of evil. Their gateway to HELL is Mount Arezura, named after a son of Ahriman who was slain by Gayomart. There are hordes of daevas; little is known about most of them. The most powerful are known by names, along with some of their powers and characteristics. According to Plutarch, the creator God Ohrmazd made 24 gods and placed them in the cosmic egg. Ahriman made 24 daevas to penetrate the egg so that evil, could mix with good. In later Zoroastrian texts, the numbers of daevas are LEGION. The wicked who follow the daevas are condemned to go to the place of Worst Thought in the afterlife, the same designation given to DRUJ.

        "name": "Demoniac",
        "description": "Person who becomes possessed by a DEMON. A demoniac undergoes a marked change in physical, mental, and emotional symptoms and behavior. Depending on the type of POSSESSION, there may be a pattern to the changes. In ancient times, demons were blamed for entering a person and taking control of him or her to cause problems. The ancient Jewish historian Josephus said that it was not a demon but the soul of a tormented person that entered a victim. Illnesses and diseases were blamed on demons, especially if a person fell into fi ts, trances, or bizarre behavior. Natural medical conditions, such as epilepsy, may have been the real causes, but in earlier times, there was little understanding of many illnesses. The attempted remedy was to undertake an EXORCISM, which would eradicate the problem. Certain empowered individuals had the knowledge, and especially the supernatural power, to help demoniacs. During the medieval and Renaissance times in Europe, demoniacs said they were cursed by witches and sorcerers (see CURSE) or were overcome by the DEVIL. The Catholic Church used possession to pursue its political agendas. Some cases of demoniacs were false; they faked their symptoms or were swept up in hysterias. (See SPIRIT OF ORLEANS.)More recently, demoniacs are said to be in “religious altered states of consciousness,” or RASC. They exhibit many of the same physical, mental, and emotional symptoms as persons who are swept up in religious or spiritual ecstasies and raptures; however, for them the experience is hellish rather than heavenly: they are under the siege of demons rather than God. Demoniacs exhibit certain symptoms, among them swellings and contortions of the body, trances, cataleptic states, transfigurations of their faces and voices, unusual behavior, self-battering and mutilation, personality and mood changes, and statements from the possessing demon, often in foreign languages—especially Latin—unknown to the demoniac. The victim shouts obscenities and blasphemies and taunts EXORCISTs and others. In more severe cases, there are uncontrollable hysterics; episodes of supernormal strength; levitation; the vomiting of unusual substances, bile and copious quantities of mucus; clairvoyance; and prophecy. The eyes may roll back into the head. Sexual assault by the demons, poltergeist phenomena, apparitions, and nightmares may happen to the victims. Demoniacs usually are not steadily possessed but act normally and then are overcome for periods of time. They may be possessed by multiple demons and have to undergo repeated exorcisms over long periods. Possession is considered life-threatening to a demoniac, though few have actually died under its infl uence. In 1590, Ann Frank, a nurse in the employ of John Dee, an English occultist, became possessed and attempted suicide. Dee’s remedy was to anoint her breast with holy oil and put her under heavy guard. After a month, she succeeded in killing herself by cutting her throat. Frank is one of the few demoniacs on record who actually committed suicide. In 1976, a young German demoniac, ANNELIESE MICHEL, died while undergoing exorcisms. She was severely emaciated and dehydrated.",

The term dybbuk (also spelled dibbuk) was coined in the 17th century from the language of German and Polish Jews. It is an abbreviation of two phrases: dibbuk me-ru’ah (a cleavage of an evil spirit) and dibbuk min ha-hizonim (dibbuk from the demonic side of man). Prior to the 17th century, the dybbuk was one of many evil spirits callibbur. In early folklore, dybbukim were thought only to inhabit the bodies of sick persons. Possessive evil spirits are referred to in the Old Testament. For example, Samuel I describes the possession of Saul and the way David exorcized the spirit by playing the harp. In the book of Tobit he archangel Raphael instructs Tobit in ways of EXORCISM. In the rabbinical literature of the fi rst century, exorcisms called for the ashes of a red heifer, or the roots of certain herbs, to be burned under the victim, who was then surrounded with water. Other methods included incantations in the name of King SOLOMON, repetition of the Divine Name of God, reading from Psalms, and wearing herbal AMULETs. By the 16th century, the concept of possessive evil spirits changed. Many Jews believed the spirits were transmigrated souls that could not enter a new body because of their past sins and so were forced to possess the body of a living sinner. The spirits were motivated to possess a body because they were tormented by other evil spirits if they did not. Some thought the dybbukim were the souls of people who were not properly buried and, therefore, became demons. The KABBALAH contains rituals for exorcizing a dybbuk; many are still in use in modern times. The exorcism must be performed by a ba’al shem, a miracle-working rabbi. Depending on how the exorcism is done, the dybbuk either is redeemed or is cast into HELL. It usually exits the body of its victim through the small toe, which shows a small, bloody hole as the point of departure.",

Empousae means “forcers in.” Empusa is sometimes translated into English as “vampire.” The empousai are children of Hecate, the goddess of the underworld (see CHTHONIC DEITIES), ghosts, and magic.    They appear at her bidding at midday when people make sacrifi ces to their dead relatives. They are filthy and ugly. They have the hind ends of asses and wear brazen slippers. Sometimes they are described as having one brass leg and one ass leg. They disguise themselves as cows, bitches, or beautiful girls. In the latter form, they seduce men. They enter the human body to consume its flesh and drink its BLOOD. In The Life of Apollonius of Tyana, Philostratus relates a story—probably highly fi ctitious—about an empousa bride. Apollonius, a philosopher and wonder worker of the first century, was credited with great feats of magic and the ability to summon spirits and see the future. Philostratus’ biography draws upon the probably fictional memoirs of one of Apollonius’ disciples, Damis. The story concerns a young man of Lycia, Menippus, age 25, smart and handsome. One day as he was walking along the road to Cenchreae, he was met by an apparition—an empousa—in the guise of a Phoenician woman. He fell under her spell and fell in love with her, not realizing what she really was. They made plans to marry. Apollonius was skeptical of her. He attended the wedding and was introduced to her by Menippus. The woman acknowledged she was the owner of all the gold and silver trappings in the house and was the mistress of all the servants. Apollonius told Menippus that his bride was an empousa who would devour his fl esh and drink his blood. Menippus’ bride was offended at this and ordered Apollonius to leave, but he had broken her spell, and all the gold, silver, and servants disappeared. The woman wept and begged Apollonius not to force her to confess her true identity, but he did. She admitted that she was fattening up Menippus for a kill, and that she loved to dine on young and beautiful bodies because their blood was pure and strong. Thus, was Menippus saved from a gruesome fate. A similar tale, not quite as demonic in nature, is told by Phlegon of Tralles in Mirabilia 1, ca. 140. Philinnion is a young bride who dies and returns as a sexually hungry ghost to visit a man, Machates. Philinnion leaves behind jewelry and underwear. Machates gives her a ring and a golden cup. When the family discovers what is going on, they visit the girl’s tomb, to fi nd her bier empty, save for Machates’ gifts. The girl herself is lying in the house where Machates is a guest. A learned prophet says her corpse should be burned outside the city limits, and many sacrifices should be made to the chthonic deities.

Most often, she takes three forms because she hovers near the Moon (which has three forms: waxing, full, and new). Enepsigos is conjured up as Kronos, Greek god of time. In the Testament of Solomon, Enepsigos is bound by King SOLOMON with a triple-link chain and is made to prophesy. She predicts that Solomon’s kingdom will be divided and the Temple of Jerusalem will be destroyed by the kings of the Persians, Medes, and Chaldeans. The tools in the temple will be used to serve other gods. The vessels used to trap all the demons will be broken by men, and the freed demons will go throughout the world, leading men astray until the Son of God is crucifi ed. This Son shall be born of a virgin and shall be the only one to hold power over all demons. His name is Emmanuel (Emmanouel), the letters of whose name add up to the numbers 644. Solomon does not believe Enepsigos and has her bound in unbreakable chains. But later he witnesses the truth of part of her prophecy, when he is led astray by women to worship pagan gods, and his kingdom is divided by God.",

The demon appears every morning when a fresh wind starts and blows until the third hour. It kills man  and beast and cannot be contained. Adarkes asks Solomon to send someone who can control the demon. Solomon, however, forgets about the request until he has a problem with the construction of the Temple of Jerusalem. The stone that he wishes for a cornerstone is so heavy that all the artisans and demon laborers cannot move it. Solomon sends a servant out into the Arabian desert to capture the wind demon in a leather flask. The servant places Solomon’s magic ring at the neck of the flask, which is a wineskin. When the demon blows into  it and fills it up, the servant seals it closed with the ring. The local Arabs do not believe that the boy has actually contained the demon, but when the wind does not blow for three days, they become convinced. The boy presents the fl ask to Solomon inside the temple. Solomon is astonished when the fl ask has the ability to move about on its own and takes seven steps, and then falls on its neck. Speaking from inside, the demon gives his name as Ephippas and says he is thwarted by “the one    who is going to be born from a virgin and crucifi ed by the Jews” (JESUS).",

Suras 7:12 and 38:76 refer to his creation from fire. However, the Qur’an also indicates that Iblis was treated as an angel. When Allah created Adam, he ordered all the angels to bow down and worship him. Iblis was among those who refused, claiming that a being made of dust was beneath him, a being of fi re. Allah cursed Iblis for his pride and expelled him from heaven. Iblis persuaded Allah to delay further punishment until the Day of Judgment. God gave him the right to roam the earth, tempting people, and to destroy those who yield to temptation. He cannot compel people to sin but only lure them to make the choice.

Larvae, also known as lemurs, are demonic ghosts of the dead who, because of their misdeeds in life, are punished in the afterlife by being sentenced to exile and eternal wandering without a home. They do not bother good men, but they harass men of evil intent. The counterpart of the larvae are lares, benevolent ghosts of the dead who guard people, homes, and places. Apuleius described both of these types of spirits in De deo Socratis: There is also another species of daemons, according to a second signifi cation, and this is a human soul, which, after its departure from the present life, does not enter into another body. I fi nd that souls of this kind are called in the ancient Latin tongue Lemures. Of these Lemures, therefore, he who, being allotted the guardianship of his posterity, dwells in a house with an appeased and tranquil power, is called a familiar [or domestic] Lar. But those are for the most part called Larvae, who, having no proper habitation, are punished with an uncertain wandering, as with a certain exile, on account of the evil deeds of their life, and become a vain terror to good, and are noxious to bad men. Romans observed a festival in May called Lemuria, for appeasing the spirits of the dead, exorcising them from households, and preventing them from causing trouble. Businesses and temples closed. The most important ritual took place on the last night of the festival, when the larvae or lemures were exorcised. The homeowner or head of the household washed his hands three times, placed black beans in his mouth, and walked barefoot through the house, making the sign of the horns with his hands (see EVIL EYE), tossing black beans over his shoulder, and saying, “With these beans I do redeem me and mine.” This incantation was repeated nine times without looking backward. The evil ghosts who followed would pick up the beans and depart, leaving the residents alone until the following year’s festival. The Greeks had a similar festival, observed in February or March. In The City of God, St. Augustine commented on larvae, believing them to be wicked demons, in reference to comments made by Plotinus: He [Plotinus] says, indeed, that the souls of men are demons, and that men become Lares if they are good, Lemures or Larvae if they are bad, and Manes if it is uncertain whether they deserve well or ill. Who does not see at a glance that this is a mere whirlpool sucking men         to moral destruction? For, however wicked men have been, if they suppose they shall become Larvae or divine Manes, they will become the worse the more love they have for infl icting injury; for, as the Larvae are hurtful demons made out of wicked men, these men must suppose that after death they will be invoked with sacrifices and divine honors that they may infl ict injuries. But this question we must not pursue. He also states that the blessed are called in Greek eudaimones, because they are good souls, that is to say, good demons, confi rming his opinion that the souls of men are demons.",

Out of the mouth go flaming torches; Sparks of fi re leap forth. . . .In his neck abides strength, And terror dances before him.

They throw him overboard and he is swallowed by Leviathan. For three days, he is imprisoned in the belly of the beast, and then God forces Leviathan to vomit him up on land. John Milton, in his epic poem Paradise Lost, describes Leviathan as “the Arch-Fiend,” who lurks about the seas around Scandinavia. He would rise to the surface and fool sailors into thinking his huge bulk was actually land. When the ships were close, he would drag them down and sink them. Leviathan was one of the possessing demons named in the LOUDUN POSSESSIONS. He is ruler of Envy, the fourth of the SEVEN DEADLY SINS.

        "name": "Lilith",
        "description": "A female DEMON of the night and SUCCUBUS who flies about searching for newborn children to kidnap or strangle and sleeping men to seduce in order to produce demon children. Lilith is a major fi gure in Jewish demonology, appearing as early as 700 B.C.E. in the book of Isaiah; she or beings similar to her also are found in myths from other cultures around the world. She is the dark aspect of the Mother Goddess. She is the original “scarlet woman” and sometimes described as a screech owl, blind by day, who sucks the breasts or navels of young children or the dugs of goats. In addition to Jewish folklore, Lilith appears in various forms in Iranian, Babylonian, Sumerian, Canaanite, Persian, Arabic, Teutonic, Mexican, Greek, English, Asian, and Native American legends. She is sometimes associated with other characters in legend and myth, including the queen of Sheba and Helen of Troy. In medieval Europe, she was often portrayed as the wife, concubine, or grandmother of SATAN. Lilith appears in different guises in various texts. She is best known as the fi rst wife of Adam, created by God as twins joined in the back. Lilith demanded equality with Adam and, failing to get it, left him in anger. Adam complained to God that his wife had deserted him. God sent three angels, Sanvi, Sansanvi, and Semangelaf, to take Lilith back to Eden. The angels found her in the Red Sea and threatened her with the loss of 100 of her demon children every day unless she returned to Adam. She refused and was punished. Lilith took revenge by launching a reign of terror against women in childbirth, newborn infants—particularly males—and men who slept alone. She was forced, however, to swear to the three angels that whenever she saw their names or images on an amulet, she would leave infants and mothers alone. After the Fall, Adam spent 130 years separated from Eve, during which Lilith went to him and satisfi ed him during sleep. They had a son, who became a frog. The earliest account of Lilith appears in a midrash, Alpha Bet Ben Sira, which attempts to resolve the discrepancies in the Torah about the creation of Lilith in Genesis, followed by the creation of Eve just a few passages later. In the midrash, God created Lilith in the same way as he did Adam, but he used fi lth and impure sediment instead of dust from the earth. Adam and Lilith were at odds with each other from the beginning, and she refused to lie beneath him during intercourse. When she saw that Adam would gain power over her, she uttered the ineffable name of God and fl ew off to a cave in the desert near the Red Sea. There, as queen of Zemargad or queen of the desert, she engaged in promiscuity, including with demons, and gave birth to 100 demonic offspring called lilim every day. The daughters all practice SORCERY, seduction, and strangling. She became the bride of SAMAEL, the DEVIL (in some accounts called Ashmodai, or ASMODEUS), in a union arranged by the Blind Dragon, an entity who has been castrated so that his offspring will not overcome the world. The lilim are hairy beings, having hair everywhere on their faces and bodies except their heads. In a text preceding the Zohar, Lilith and Samael are born joined as androgynous twins from an emanation beneath the throne of glory. They are the lower aspects of another androgynous twin, Adam and Eve. In the Zohar, Lilith arises from an evil shell or husk, a KELIPPAH, that is created in the waning of the Moon. In the beginning, the Sun and Moon were equal, and this created a rivalry. To end it, God diminished the Moon and made it rule the night. Lilith’s powers are at their peak when the Moon is dark. She is the seducer of men and the strangler of children; the latter role is sometimes attributed to NAAMAH. Lilith, who has the upper body of a beautiful woman and a lower body of fire, carries the fi ery resentment of the Moon. Lilith lurks under doorways, in wells, and in latrines, waiting to seduce men. She is adorned with the “ornaments for seduction”: Her hair is long and red like the rose, her cheeks are white and red, from her ears hang six ornaments, Egyptian cords and all the ornaments of the Land of the East hang from her nape. Her mouth is set like a narrow door comely in its decor, her tongue is sharp like a sword, her words are smooth like oil, her lips are red like a rose and sweetened by all the sweetness in the world. She is dressed in scarlet and adorned with forty ornaments less one. Men who sleep alone are especially vulnerable to Lilith. The Zohar also describes Lilith as a female aspect of LEVIATHAN, who has a SERPENT body. She is Leviathan, the Tortuous Serpent, the counterpart to the male aspect, Leviathon, the Slant Serpent. Lilith is the serpent who tempts Eve with the apple of forbidden knowledge in paradise and thus instigates the Fall. She also persuades Eve to seduce Adam while she is menstruating and impure. The numerical value of Lilith’s name equals the Hebrew word for “screech.” Thus, Lilith is the “demon of screeching” and “the princess of screeching” and is personified as a screech owl. In legend, on the Day of Atonement, Lilith spends the day in a screeching battle with MAHALATH, a concubine to Samael. They taunt each other so much that the very earth trembles. Also on the Day of Atonement, Lilith goes forth into the desert with 420 LEGIONs of her demons, and they march about while she screeches. Lilith is also known as Lady of the Beasts, who rules the wilderness and all beasts, the animal side of human nature. In her guise as the queen of Sheba, she attempted to seduce King SOLOMON. He discovered her true nature by having the DJINN build a throne room with a fl oor of glass. Lilith mistook it for water and raised her garments in order to cross it to his throne. Her hairy, bestial legs were revealed in the refl ection of the glass. AMULETs and INCANTATION BOWLs traditionally protected new mothers and infants against Lilith. Common amulets were knives and hands inscribed with CHARMs; some had bells attached. Frogs also protect against her. Male infants were vulnerable for the first week of life, girls for the fi rst three weeks. Sometimes a magic circle was drawn around the lying-in bed, with a charm inscribed with the names of the three angels, Adam and Eve, and the words barring Lilith or protect this newborn child from all harm. Sometimes amulets with such inscriptions were placed in all corners of and throughout the bedchamber. If a child laughed in its sleep, it was a sign that Lilith was present. Tapping the child on the nose made the demon go away. According to lore, men who had nocturnal emissions believed they had been seduced by Lilith during the night and had to say incantations to prevent the offspring from becoming demons. Any seed spilled during sex, even marital sex, is at risk for becoming lilim.",

        "name": "Lucifer",
        "description": "FALLEN ANGEL sometimes equated with SATAN. In Latin, Lucifer means “light bringer,” and he originally was associated with Venus, the morning star. Lucifer’s identity as a prideful angel cast out of heaven with his followers—who became DEMONs—rests mainly on legend and poetic literature, such as in the works of Dante and John Milton. The sole biblical reference to Lucifer occurs in Isaiah 14:12: “How you are fallen from heaven, O Day Star, son of Dawn!” The reference is probably to the boastful king of Babylon, a prediction of the fall of Babylon and its king. Jerome’s translation of the Bible, the Latin Vulgate, made Lucifer the chief fallen angel. His rebellion against God with the sin of pride caused him and his followers to be cast from heaven. The fallen angels lost their beauty and power and became demons. 2 Enoch, also called the Slavonic Apocalypse of Enoch, names the leader of the fallen as SATANAEL (Satanail). The text may date to the late fi rst century, although some scholars believe it to be of medieval origin, because it exists only in Slavonic. According to the text, God creates the ranks of angels on the second day of creation, shaping them out of a great fire cut off from rock. He gives them clothing of burning fl ames and fi ery weapons. He gives orders that each one should stand in his own rank. God tells the prophet Enoch: But one from the order of the archangels deviated, together with the division that was under his authority. He thought up the impossible idea, that he might place his throne higher than the clouds which are above the earth, and thus he might become equal to my power. And I hurled him out from the height, together with his angels. And he was fl ying around in the air, ceaselessly, above the Bottomless. Lucifer has received most attention in Christianity. In the early years of Christianity, the name was sometimes applied to Christ as the light bearer. The early church father Origen, who lived in the second and third centuries, equated Lucifer and Satan; later, Augustine and Jerome were among those who followed suit. By the Middle Ages, both Lucifer and Satan were used as names for the DEVIL. Lucifer could apply to the Devil in either his prefall or postfall state. Milton’s Paradise Lost and Dante’s Inferno strengthened the connection of Lucifer to Satan.In Mormonism, Lucifer (Helel in Hebrew) is a brilliant and powerful archangel, a son of Elohim (God the Father) and brother to Yahweh (God the Son, Jehovah, or Jesus) and to all of the children of Elohim including all of the souls of humanity. Lucifer became obsessed with pride and attempted to take over Elohim’s family and subvert the Father’s plan for his children. A struggle of wills ensued, and Lucifer and his followers lost. They are exiled to Earth and are permitted to tempt people. When Elohim’s purpose has been fulfi lled, Lucifer and his demonis will be exiled to the “Outer Darkness,” completely cut off from divine light and love. In the hierarchies of demons in magical lore, Lucifer s emperor of HELL and ranks above Satan, one of his lieutenants. When conjured, he appears as a beautiful child. Lucifer rules Europeans and Asiatics. In the 19th century, Leo Taxil, a Frenchman who excelled in occult hoaxes, perpetrated the fraud that Freemasonry was associated with worship of Lucifer. Although the hoax was thoroughly exposed, Taxil continues to be cited by opponents of Freemasonry Some modern occultists and satanists see Lucifer as an archangel of light who will incarnate in human form at key times to confer enlightenment and redemption.",

        "name": "Malleus",
        "description": "The most influential and important witch hunter’s guide of the Inquisition. Published fi rst in Germany in 1487, the Malleus Malefi carum was translated into dozens of editions throughout Europe and England and was the leading reference for witch trials on the Continent for about 200 years. It was adopted by both Protestant and Catholic civil and ecclesiastical judges. It was second only to the Bible in sales until John Bunyan’s Pilgrim’s Progress was published in 1678. The book gives instructions for interrogating, trying, and punishing accused witches and details the nature, characteristics, and behavior of DEMONs and the DEVIL. Fourteen editions were published by 1520; another 16 editions appeared by 1669. By the end of the 17th century, there were more than 30 editions. The book became the definitive guide by which inquisitors and judges conducted themselves and that subsequent writers used as a foundation for their own works. The book was important in the way it linked witchcraft to heresy. It has been described in the centuries since as a vicious and cruel work, the most damaging book of its kind during the Inquisition. Authorship The Malleus Malefi carum is credited to the authorship of two Dominican inquisitors, Heinrich Kramer and James Sprenger, though historians now believe that it was written by Kramer, by far the more zealous of the two and one of the most zealous participants in the entire Inquisition. Kramer and Sprenger were empowered by Pope Innocent VIII in his bull of December 9, 1484, to prosecute witches throughout northern Germany. The papal edict was intended to quell Protestant opposition to the Inquisition and to solidify the case made in 1258 by Pope Alexander IV for the prosecution of witches as heretics. It was the opinion of the church that the secular arm, the civil courts, were not punishing enough witches solely on the basis of their evildoing. Both Kramer and Sprenger were prolifi c writers. Kramer, also known as Institoris, the latinized version of his name, rose to power as an inquisitor and was known to have framed some of his victims. He was violently opposed to witchcraft and seemed also to harbor hatred against women, whom he viewed as inherently weak and evil. He sought to establish a direct connection between women and diabolic witchcraft. Some historians also think that Kramer was reacting to broader sentiments of the time that were responses to the infl uences of holy women and mystics such as St. Catherine of Siena, a powerful fi gure consulted by royalty and heads of state. He did praise the saintliness of certain holy women who were able to resist the lustful temptations indulged in by witches, in his view. Sprenger was a distinguished friar, and he may have allowed Kramer to use his name in Kramer’s virulent antiwitch treatise, Apologia auctoris in Malleus Malefi carum, written by 1485. He had some association with Kramer in trials of accused witches. Kramer’s treatise was absorbed into the Malleus Malefi carum. After its publication, evidence surfaced that Kramer may have fabricated one of the offi cial letters authorizing the work. Relations between Kramer and Sprenger became strained. After Sprenger died in 1496, his colleagues attempted to distance his legacy from Kramer. Little is known about Kramer’s activities after publication of the Malleus in 1487 until his death in 1505. He remained an inquisitor. In 1500, Pope Alexander VI appointed him papal nuncio and inquisitor of Bohemia and Moravia. He was pursuing witches and heretics in Bohemia at the time of his death. Contents The Malleus is based on the biblical pronouncement “Thou shall not suffer a witch to live” (Exodus 22:18) and draws on Scripture and the works of Aristotle, St. Augustine, and St. Thomas Aquinas as support. It maintains that because God acknowledged witches, to doubt witchcraft is heresy. The book is divided into three parts and organized as questions answered by opposing arguments. Part 1 concerns how the Devil and his witches, with “the permission of Almighty God,” perpetrate a variety of evils upon men and animals, including succubi and incubi, instilling hatred, obstructing or destroying fertility, and causing the metamorphosis, or shape shifting, of human beings into beasts. God permits these acts; otherwise, the Devil would have unlimited power and destroy the world. Part 2 describes how witches cast spells and bewitchments and do their evil and how these actions can be prevented or remedied. Particular emphasis is given to Devil’s PACTs, a key to proving heresy. The existence of witches and their malefi cia is treated as unassailable fact, and wild stories of SABBATs and other abominations are presented as truth. Most of the stories are from the inquisitions conducted by Sprenger and Kramer and from material of other ecclesiastical witchcraft writers. Part 3 sets forth the legal procedures for trying witches, including the taking of testimony, admission of evidence, methods of interrogation and torture, and guidelines for sentencing. Judges are instructed to allow hostile witnesses because everyone hates witches. Torture is to be applied if the accused do not confess voluntarily. Judges are permitted to lie to the accused, promising them mercy if they confess, a tactic readily employed by Kramer. This, the text argues, is all done in the best interest of society and the state. The Malleus allows for light sentences of penance and imprisonment in certain cases but urges execution of as many witches as possible. Most of the instructions on sentencing pertain to death. Some questions are not answered clearly and contradictions abound. For example, the authors say that the Devil, through witches, mainly affl icts good and just people, then says only the wicked are vulnerable. At one point, judges are said to be immune to the bewitchments of witches; at another, witches cast spells over judges with the glance of an eye, and judges are admonished to protect themselves with salt and sacraments. The Malleus Malefi carum was refuted by JOHANN WEYER.",

Mephistopheles is more of a literary figure than one belonging to mythology and demonology. He is usually described as a tall man wearing black clothing. The origin of the name Mephistophiles is uncertain. The name was known to the German occultist Johannes Trithemius (1442–1516), who described him as “a mysterious kind of demon, dark through and through, malicious, restless, stormy.” “Mephistophiles” appears in 1527 in a Renaissance magical text, Praxis Magia Faustiana, and later as “Mephostophiles” in the Faust chapbook Historia von D. Johann Fausten, fi rst published in 1587 by an anonymous author. The chapbook tells the story of Dr. Johann Georg Faust, who bargains his soul to the Devil. Mephistophiles is invisible to others but can be seen by Faust in various shape-shifted guises, including as a grey friar monk. Dr Fausts Hollenzwang describes “Mephistophiel” as one of the seven great princes of HELL, who “stands under the planet Jupiter, his regent is named Zadkiel, an enthroned angel of the holy Jehovah . . . his form is fi rstly that of a fiery bear, the other and fairer appearance is as of a little man with a black cape and a bald head.” The demon also manifests as an invisible ringing bell. Mephistopheles is a trickster and practical joker, who serves the lusts and desires of Faust. In the end, he is a shrewd negotiator who has the last laugh by trapping Faust into damnation. In some accounts, however, Faust manages to redeem himself and escape eternal punishment in hell. The chapbooks inspired Christopher Marlowe’s play The Tragic History of Doctor Faustus and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe’s drama Faust.

In mythology, Nemesis is the daughter of either Oceanus or Zeus. She is usually portrayed as a somber winged maiden with a whip, rein, sword, or scales in her left hand. Sometimes she is portrayed as holding a cubit ruler in her left hand and a staff in her right, with one foot on a wheel. She personifies resentment against men who commit callous crimes, those who are wicked and insolent, and those who have too much good fortune. Her job is to be the “leveler,” to effect equilibrium by making sure that wrongdoers get their due. The Romans called Nemesis Invidia (Jealousy) and Rivalitas (Jealous Rivalry). In modern terms, a “nemesis” is one’s worst enemy. Nemesis-stone rings were AMULETs against evil. A Nemesis stone was a stone taken from an altar to Nemesis and engraved with her image. Placed under the stone were the tip of a duck wing and a piece of a mullein, called “death plant.” When this ring amulet was given to a person who was possessed, it caused the demon to confess himself and flee. When worn around the neck, the ring warded off nightmares caused by demons and protected children against LAMIAE. The ring also cured “moonstruck” conditions (insanity). In order for the ring to work properly, the wearer had to avoid everything abominable and wicked. Lore also held that the ring would reveal the length of someone’s life and the manner of his or her death.",

Nephilim means “fallen,” “those who have fallen,” or “those who were cast down.” The Nephilim sometimes are called the SONS OF GOD, as are their angel parents. Helel is their chief. The Nephilim displeased God. Genesis 6:4 implies that the Nephilim were already present upon the earth when the Sons of God began their relations with mortal women: “The Nephilim were upon the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of god came into the daughters of men, and they bore children to them. These were the mighty men that were of old, the men of renown.” The corruption brought by the mingling of angels and humans caused God to regret that he had created human beings on Earth. He decided to blot out not only the human race but every living thing on Earth. He selected Noah and his family to survive this disaster, the great flood, and repopulate the world. Evidently not all the Nephilim perished, however, for a later reference in Numbers refers to the Anakim, the sons of the Nephilim: “And there we saw the Nephilim (the sons of Anak, who come from the Nephilim); and we seemed to ourselves like grasshoppers and so we seemed to them” (13:33). The Anakim were later destroyed. 1 Enoch presents a more descriptive picture of the Nephilim as monstrous beings (people) in order to eat them. And they began to sin against birds, wild beasts, reptiles and fish. And their flesh was devoured the one by the other, and they drank blood. And then the earth brought an accusation against the oppressors. (7:3–7) 0eanwhile, the Watchers spread more corruption by teaching people secret and magical arts they are not supposed to know. From the heavens above, the angels Michael, Gabriel, and Surafal observe in horror the bloodshed and oppression upon the earth. They hear the prayers of the people begging for help. They petition God to intervene, saying that the giants have fi lled Earth with blood and oppression. God declares that he will punish these transgressions with complete destruction in the flood. He tells Gabriel: Proceed against the bastards and the reprobates and the children of adultery; and destroy the children of adultery and expel the children of the Watchers from among the people and send them against one another (so that) they may be destroyed in the fight, for length of days have they not. They will beg you everything—for their fathers on behalf of themselves because they hope to live an eternal life. (They hope) that each one of them will live a period of 500 years. (10:9–11) The Nephilim also are the subject of a Qumran text referred to as the Enochic Book of Giants (4Q532). The text tells that two Nephilim sons of SEMYAZA (leader of the Watchers), named Ahya and Ohya, have a shared dream vision in which they visit a world garden and see 200 trees being cut down by angels. They do not understand the dream and so they take it to the Nephilim council. The council appoints one of their members, Mahawai, to consult Enoch in paradise and ask him what it means. Mahawai rises up into the air like the whirlwinds and flies with the help of his hands like an eagle until he reaches Enoch. Enoch says that the 200 trees symbolize the 200 Watchers who are going to be destroyed in the coming fl ood. Later in the text, Mahawai transforms into a bird again to make another journey. He fl ies too close to the Sun and is threatened with incineration. He is saved by Enoch, whose voice descends from heaven to tell him to turn back and not die prematurely.",

He has shape-shifting ability: He strangles men born under the sign of Aquarius because they have passion for women born under the sign of Virgo; he becomes a man who likes boys and causes them pain when he touches them; he turns into a heavenly winged creature; and he can assume the form of a lion. During the construction of Solomon’s Temple of Jerusalem, Ornias appears at sunset and takes half the wages and food of the master workman’s boy—Solomon’s favorite—and sucks out his soul through his right thumb. The boy grows thin. Solomon asks him why he is losing weight, and the boy tells him about Ornias. Incensed, Solomon begs God for help to have authority over the demon. The  archangel Michael gives him a magical ring with a seal engraved upon it that will bestow the power upon Solomon. Michael tells Solomon, “You shall imprison all the demons, male and female, and with their help you shall build Jerusalem when you bear this seal of God.” Solomon gives the ring to the boy and instructs him to fling it at the demon’s chest when he next appears and 6rder him to go to Solomon. When Ornias next appears, as a flaming fire, the boy does so and shouts, “Come! Solomon summons you!” Ornias screams and promises to give the boy all the gold and silver on Earth if he will give the ring back to Solomon. But the boy binds the demon and delivers him to the king. Solomon fi nds the demon trembling at his gates and goes to interrogate him. Ornias says that he is descended from an archangel and is thwarted by the archangel Uriel (see THWARTING ANGELS). He says he resides in the constellation Aquarius, where he strangles “those who reside in Aquarius because of their passion for women whose zodiacal sign is Virgo.” Ornias says that while in trance, he undergoes three transformations: “Sometimes I am a man who craves the bodies of effeminate boys, and when I touch them, they suffer great pain. Sometimes I am a creature with wings (flying) up to the heavenly regions. Finally, I assume the appearance of a lion.” Solomon binds the demon with his ring and sets him to work cutting stone from the quarry. Terrifi ed by IRON, the demon begs for a measure of freedom, promising to call up other demons. Solomon summons Uriel, who forces Ornias to cut stones by terrorizing him. Uriel calls up sea monsters and withers them, casting them to the ground. When that work is done, Solomon orders Ornias to fetch the Prince of Demons. He gives Ornias the magical ring, and the demon goes to BEELZEBUB. The Prince of Demons is unimpressed by the name of Solomon, so Ornias throws the ring at his chest and commands him to go to the king. Beelzebub cries out like one burned by fire and does as commanded. Ornias has the gift of prophecy, explaining to Solomon that demons fl y up to heaven, where they overhear God’s plans. Those who are exhausted by doing so become FALLING STARS.",

His body is covered with the scars of battle wounds. He can stand as tall as a mountain and with a single look stop the Sun and Moon in their paths. He breaks all laws and ravishes any woman of his choice. He has a regal bearing. The Ramayana tells a great deal about Ravana. The city of Lanka, solid gold, was built by Visva-Karma for Ravana’s half brother, Kuvera. Ravana overthrew him and stole his magical chariot, which he uses to leave the island and stir up trouble in the worlRavana has a trickster side to him. He spent years in penance to Brahma, then forced the great god to repay him by making him invulnerable to all the gods. Then he declared war on the gods, who could not defeat him. He captured many of them, forcing them into servitude on Lanka. Eventually they escaped and plotted their revenge. Ravana went next to Siva and did penance, hoping for the favor of immortality. He stood on one of his heads for 1,000 years. Siva was unmoved. Ravana cut off the head and stood on another one for 1,000 years. This went on until Ravana had exhausted all of his heads, and it seemed that he would have to cut off the last one. Siva at last granted Ravana immortality, the most beautiful woman in the world, and the sacred phallus, Atmalingham, for his mother. The boons were short-lived, however, for Siva tricked Ravana on his return to Lanka and forced him to return all the favors. Ravana declared war on the gods again. Still unable to defeat him because of his invulnerability, they appealed to Vishnu for help. Vishnu cut himself into quarters, each of which became mortal. The strongest and purest was Rama, who had the power to kill Ravana. Ravana kidnapped Rama’s wife, Sita, and imprisoned her on Lanka. He threatened to eat her unless she agreed to marry him. Sita held him off long enough for Rama to build a bridge to Lanka, where Rama engaged in battles with Ravana. Finally, Rama shot an arrow clean through the demon, killing him."

Fearful that Samael and Lilith would fl ood the world with their offspring, God castrated Samael. When God ordered the patriarch Abraham to kill his son, Isaac, Samael tried to persuade Abraham not to do it, in order to disobey God. When Abraham refused, Samael went to Abraham’s wife, Sarah, and told her Isaac  was sacrifi ced to God, the news of which killed her instantly.

        "name": "Satan",
        "description": "The personifi cation of evil and the head of all DEMONs. He is equated with the DEVIL. Satan is a Hebrew word meaning “adversary” and originally was not a proper name. Satan has evolved over the centuries to become the opposite and the opponent of God, the Prince of Darkness, and the subverter of souls. His goal is turn to human beings away from God so that they become condemned to eternal torment in HELL. Satan, as the proper name of a being, makes scant appearance in religious texts prior to the New Testament. There is no mention of “the” Satan, or even “a” satan in Genesis. The SERPENT who tempts Eve is not equated with Satan. The Old Testament features a variety of satan adversaries, including an angel adversary in the story of Balaam and the ass in the book of Numbers; lying spirits; and, in the book of Job, a satan, who is one of the SONS OF GOD, and who walks the earth looking for people to test concerning their devotion to God. In the case of the pious and devout Job, God gives the satan permission to test him, and he suffers years of setbacks, disasters, and losses. A satan, as an accuser, is mentioned in the book of Zechariah. In 1 Chronicles, a satan stands up and challenges David to take a census of the people. Psalm 109 refers to wicked men as satans, and they should be punished by Yahweh.        In the New Testament, Satan becomes more personified as a particular, single entity, and the terms Devil and Satan are used interchangeably. The Gospels tell of Satan’s testing JESUS in the wilderness. In Mark, he is named as Satan; in Matthew and Luke, he is “the tester” or “the Devil.” In Luke, the Devil promises Jesus earthly glory if he will pay the proper homage. In Luke 10, Jesus comments that he has seen Satan “fallen like lightning from the sky,” a reference similar to the fall of LUCIFER in Isaiah that is probably a prophecy of a fall to come, not one that occurred in the past. Luke also states that Satan entered into Judas to induce him to betray Jesus. The Gospel of John makes references to the Devil. In the first, he is the “man-killer from the beginning” who does not stand for Truth, a reference often taken to refer to the serpent in the Garden of Eden. Jesus refers to him as the Ruler of the World. The Devil and Satan are both in reference to entering into the heart of Judas. The Epistles refer to both the Devil and Satan. Paul refers to Satan by name as obstructing his efforts to spread the gospel, as a tester of men’s morals and faith, and as an agent of punishment for the wicked. In 2 Corinthians 2.10–11, Paul indicates that Satan has his own designs on the world, and that forgiveness will outwit Satan. In the same letter, Paul urges people to be on guard against Satan, who can disguise himself as an angel of light. He also says that an “angel of Satan” has been sent to batter him, to prevent him from becoming too puffed up with his own pride. Paul did not see Satan as marshaling an army of demons; rather, he said that demons were the lifeless idols of the pagans. In Ephesians, Paul gives advice for spiritual armaments against Satan and warns that committing sins will make room for him. In Hebrews, Satan has the power of death, and it is Christ’s mission to overcome him. In Revelation, Satan is synonymous with the dragon and serpent. He tests people, battles angels, and is punished and bound. The early church fathers did more to cement the identity of Satan with the Devil and the tempter in the Garden of Eden, and with Lucifer. In the second century, Justin Martyr was the fi rst to identify Satan with the serpent. He said the fall of Satan at the hands of Christ was predicted in Isaiah in the description of the fall of Lucifer. Justin also linked Satan with the Sons of God, or WATCHERS, and associated the powers and principalities (two orders of angels) of the Epistles with pagan gods and demons. Other church fathers, such as Theophilus and Tertullian, also placed Satan as tempter in the Garden. According to Cyprian, the Devil was once a beloved and intimate angel of God, who perished at the beginning of the world out of envy over humanity. In losing his own immortality, he took away the immortality of humans. Irenaeus echoed this view. Origen (ca. 185–250) was the first church father to reinterpret Satan within the context of Lucifer. The Life of Adam and Eve, a pseudepigraphal text written around 100 A.D., states that the angel Satan was ordered by the archangel Michael to bow down and worship Adam, made in the image of God, but he refused because Adam was inferior, saying that Adam ought to worship him. The angels under Satan also refused, and God cast them all out of heaven. Muhammad was influenced by this text and retells the story in the Qur’an 10 times; the Devil is named IBLIS, who is head of the DJINN. The idea that Satan was cast down because of his refusal to worship Adam did not take hold in Christianity, however. Satan is jealous of humans, but only after his fall. Satan later became identifi ed with gods of paganism. The idea was developed that Satan had rights over humanity and the world because of the sin of Adam and Eve; redemption was made through Christ, who paid off the debt with his own life. According to St. Augustine, Adam’s sin meant that the whole of humanity fell under the servitude of Satan.In the Middle Ages, legends and hagiographies of the saints were popular, offering many stories of saints besting the Satan and his demons and curing DEMONIACs of their POSSESSION. St. Thomas Aquinas, one of the greatest and most infuential theologians of the church, saw only one Devil, Satan, and never referred to “devils” in the plural unless he was quoting other writers. Aquinas said that the only two sins angels can commit are pride and envy, for all other sins are related to physical appetites. According to Aquinas, demons have no possibility of redemption and can only go to hell (where they torment the dead) or Smoggy Air (where they torment the living). He said human beings deserved to be turned over to Satan because of Adam’s sin. At some point—the origins are unclear—Satan became the ruler of hell and the chief tormenter of souls of the dead. From the 16th century on, his primary role was tempter of humanity. The artist William Blake saw Satan as the imagination, a view also held in Sufism. Even by the 18th century, Satan seemed an outdated superstition to some theologians, among them the infl uential Daniel Ernst Schleiermacher (1768–1834), a minister in the Reformed Church. The concept of the Devil was unenlightened, he argued, pointing out that Jesus and the disciples made few direct references to Satan. Schleiermacher argued that Satan does not exist and is used as a convenient metaphor for evil. Since the mid-20th century, belief in Satan has risen, in part the result of the rise of fundamentalism, and of interest in demonic POSSESSION."

The shedim are a man’s “demonic children.” When a man dies, they go to the grave to weep. Tradition called for a man’s legitimate offspring to stay away from the graveside at burial in order to avoid dangers from the shedim. A 17th-century account of beliefs of German Jews describes them: They [Jews] fi rmly believe that if a man’s seed escapes him, it gives rise, with the help of mahlath [a female demon] and Lilith, to evil spirits, which however die when the time comes. When a man dies and his children begin to weep and lament, these shedim, or evil spirits, come too, wishing, along with the other children, to have their part in the deceased as their father; they tug and pluck at him, so that he feels the pain, and God himself, when He sees this noxious offspring by the corpse, is reminded of the dead man’s sins. One custom called for 10 men to dance in a circle around a man’s body seven times before it was lowered into the grave, reciting the 91st Psalm or other prayers to ward off the shedim. Then a stone was laid on the bier while Genesis 25:6 was recited: “But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away.” In later lore, the shedim were hairy, wild DEMONs who lived in the woods and danced. They were known for their tricks, such as leaving human beings with grotesque deformities if they were displeased. The shedim are ruled by ASMODEUS."

        "name": "Succubus",
        "description": "A DEMON who takes the form of a beautiful woman in order to seduce men. The succubus, along with its male counterpart, the INCUBUS, appears in ancient mythologies. Succubi appear in the flesh as beautiful, voluptuous women. They visit men in their sleep—especially men who sleep alone—and cause erotic dreams, nightmares, and nocturnal emissions. During the European witch hunts, succubi were agents of the DEVIL, who continually tempted men to commit sexual sins, sometimes by promising them immortality in return. Succubi were not as prevalent as incubi in witch hunt cases. The prevailing belief of the time was that women were more licentious than men and, therefore, offered more opportunity for incubi. If a succubus assaulted a man, it was probably not his fault, according to demonologists of the day. NICHOLAS REMY wrote in Demonolatry of a succubus case that happened in 1581. A man named Petrone Armenterious of Dalheim was persuaded by a succubus, Abrahel, to murder his son. He was so overcome with grief and guilt that he contemplated suicide. Abrahel told him that if he worshipped her, he would restore the boy to life. He complied, and his son returned to the living. But it was all an illusion, for the boy suddenly died again and immediately stank abominably. The sex act itself with a succubus was said to be an awful experience, like penetrating a cavern of ice. Sometimes, a succubus was really an incubus in disguise, who collected a man’s semen and used it to impregnate a woman. Some believed that sex with succubi could produce demon children. The Hebrew night demon, LILITH, bore an infi nite number of demon sons this way. Men accused of witchcraft were tortured until they confessed having sex with demons, among other demonic crimes. In 1468, in Bologna, Italy, a man was executed for allegedly running a brothel of succubi. The MALLEUS MALEFICARUM (1487), the chief inquisitors’ handbook, set forth fi ve ways to get rid of a succubus: • by reciting the Ave Maria • by making a sacramental confession • by making the sign of the cross • by moving to a new home • by having a priest or holy man excommunicate the demon The Lord’s Prayer and holy water also were said to work a cure. FRANCESCO-MARIA GUAZZO wrote of one alleged succubus incident in Compendium Malefi carum (1608), in which a succubus forced herself on a young man near Aberdeen, Scotland. The succubus visited him in bed every night and stayed until dawn. The young man claimed that he tried to get rid of the succubus, but to no avail. Finally, the local bishop ordered him to go away to another place and devote himself to prayer and fasting. After several days, the young man said the succubus left him. At the end of the 17th century, an odd lawsuit was tried in court in Posen, Germany. A young man forced his way into the cellar of a locked home and was later found dead on the threshold. Demons then set up housekeeping inside and created severe disturbances. The owners of the home were frightened into leaving. Local exorcists failed to expel the demons, and so an expert was summoned, Rabbi Joel Baal Shem of Zamosz. He was able to induce the demons to disclose their identity. They claimed the house belonged to them, and they demanded the opportunity to prove it in a court of law. The case was tried with Rabbi Joel and an invisible demon advocate, who could be heard. According to the demons, the previous owner of the home had engaged in intercourse with a succubus, who had borne hybrid children. The man was persuaded by a rabbi to break off his affair, but the demon demanded that the cellar be given to it and the offspring as inheritance. The man and all his heirs were now dead, and the demon children demanded possession of the house. The new homeowners said they had lawfully purchased the house. The demon children were not legitimate “seed of men” and so had no legal rights. In addition, the demon had forced the previous owner into sexual relations. The court decided against the demons, saying that their abodes were deserts and wastelands, not the homes of men. Rabbi Joel performed EXORCISMs that drove away the demons"

Veltis is mentioned in the lore of the life of St. Margaret of Antioch, who was executed by beheading in Christian persecutions in 304. While in prison, Margaret prayed to  have a face-to-face confrontation with the DEVIL. Upon arising from prayer, she saw a terrible dragon, which threatened to devour her. She made the sign of the cross and the dragon burst into flames. Then, she saw a black man sitting with his hands bound to his knees. She took him by the hair and cast him to the ground, holding his head down with her foot. She prayed, and a light shone down from heaven, illuminating her cell. She saw in heaven the cross of Christ with a dove on it. The dove said, “Blessed art thou o Margaret, the gates of paradise attend thy coming.” Margaret demanded that the demon give his name, and he asked her fi rst to remove her foot from his head. She did, and he gave the name Veltis. He said that he and other demons had been locked up in the brazen vessel. Babylonians found it and, thinking that it contained gold, smashed it and thus freed the demons. Ever since, Veltis and the others have lain in wait to annoy the just. REGINALD SCOT, a skeptic about the powers of the DEVIL and demons, dismissed the legend as a fi ction, saying Margaret could not have possibly had the eyesight and hearing to perceive anything as far away as heaven. Surely, the demons could have used their fi ery nature and breath to melt the brazen vessel at any time. “The devils carry hell and hell fi re about with them always; insomuch as (they say) they leave ashes evermore where they stand,” he noted. Scot opined that anyone who burned a candle in the name of St. Margaret “shall never be the better, but three pence the worse."

        "name": "Watchers",
        "description": "FALLEN ANGELs. The Watchers cohabited with human women and fell from God’s grace. Watchers are also referred to as SONS OF GOD. Their monstrous offspring, the NEPHILIM, and the corruption the Watchers created on Earth so revolted God that he decided to send the great flood to destroy all life on Earth. The cohabitation of the Sons of God and the daughters of men is briefl y described in Genesis 6:1–4. Watchers also describes ANGELs who do not fall but who are close to the throne of God, thus causing some confusion as to whether they are good or bad. 1 Enoch tells in detail the story of the Watchers and their fall. The Watchers, described as angels who are “the children of heaven,” see the beautiful daughters of men and desire them. They decide to take them as wives. But their leader, SEMYAZA, expresses the fear that he alone will be held accountable for this great sin. The angels, who are 200 in number, swear an oath binding them all together. Their chiefs (called chiefs of tens) who serve under Semyaza are Arakeb, Rameel, Tamel, Ramel, Danel, Ezeqel, Baraqyal, Asel, Armaros, Batrel, Ananel, Zaqeel,Sasomaspweel, Kestarel, Turel, Yamayol, and Arazyal. The Watchers descend to Earth and take the women. Many of them commit adultery against their new wives. Their offspring, the giant Nephilim, turn against people, cannibalize them, and drink their blood. The Watchers teach people secret arts such as magical medicine, incantations, and knowledge of plants and herbs. AZAZEL teaches the art of making weapons of war, jewelry, and cosmetics, and dye making and alchemy. Amasras teaches plant lore and how to perform magic. Baraqiyal teaches astrology, Kokarerel teaches the zodiac, Tamel teaches about the stars, and Asderel teaches about the Moon and the deception of humans. Later in the text, 1 Enoch gives the names of 21 chiefs of the fallen (some angels are named more than once): Semyaza Aristaqis Armen Kokbael Turel Rumyal Danyul Neqael Baraqel Azazel Armaros Betryal Besasel Hananel Turel Sipwesel Yeterel Tumael Turel Rumel Azazel Fallen angels who are known as the Five Satans: • Yeqon, who misleads all the children of the angels, brings them down upon the earth, and perverts them by the daughters of the people • Asbel, who misleads holy angels so that they will defi le their bodies by the daughters of the people • Gaderel, who shows the children of the people all the blows of death, who misleads Eve, and who shows the children of the people how to make weapons and all other instruments of war and death • Pinene, who demonstrates to people the bitter and the sweet, reveals to them all the secrets of wisdom, and teaches them the secret of writing with ink and paper, thus causing them to err through all eternity • Kasadya, “who reveals the flagellations of all evil including the fl agellation of the souls and the DEMONs, the smashing of the embryo in the womb so that it may be crushed, and the fl agellation of the soul; snake bites, sun strokes, and the son of the SERPENT whose name is Tabata” according to 1 Enoch 69:4–12 Sin, corruption, and oppression spread across the earth. Horrifi ed, the angels Michael, Surafel (Suriel/Uriel), and Gabriel petition God to take action, for the people on Earth are suffering. God declares that he will wipe out the wicked and all life on Earth in a great fl ood. He instructs Raphael to bind Azazel hand and foot and to throw him into darkness. Raphael makes a hole in the desert, casts Azazel into it, and covers him with sharp rocks. God tells Gabriel to destroy the children of the Watchers. He tells Michael to inform Semyaza that they will die together with their wives and children in their defi lement. He is to bind them for 70 generations beneath rocks until the day of judgment. They will then be led into the bottom of fi re, where they will be locked up in prison and in torment forever. All those who collaborated with  the Watchers will be similarly punished. Finally, Michael is to eradicate injustice from the face of the Earth. The Watchers call to the prophet Enoch for help, and he hears them in a dream vision. Upon awakening, he tells Azazel there will be no peace for him, for a grave judgment has come upon him. Enoch then speaks to all the Watchers, who are full of fear and trembling. They beg him to write a prayer of forgiveness for them. Enoch records their prayers and petitions and then reads them until he falls asleep. He has another dream vision in which he sees plagues. When he awakens, he goes to the Watchers and reprimands them for their sins and tells them their petitions will not be heard. Enoch nonetheless tries to intercede on behalf of the Watchers but is refused by God. God says that their giant offspring shall be called evil spirits upon the earth, for they will dwell on the earth and in the earth. He tells Enoch to inform the Watchers that because they have rejected heaven, they shall have no peace. 1 Enoch also gives the names of “the holy angels who watch,” implying that the term Watchers was given to angels in heaven, not just the fallen ones. The holy angels are • Suruel—angel of eternity and trembling • Raphael—angel of the spirits of man • Raguel—angel who takes vengeance for the world and for the luminaries • Michael—angel who is obedient in his benevolence over the people and the nations • Saraqael—angel who is over the spirits of mankind and who is in the spirit • Gabriel—angel who oversees the garden of Eden, the serpents, and the cherubim In 2 Enoch, Enoch sees the “innumerable armies” of the Watchers and Nephilim imprisoned in the fi fth heaven. They are dejected and silent. Enoch, who unsuccessfully tries to intercede on their behalf with God, urges them to sing a liturgy to God so that God will not be enraged against them “to the limit.” They do so, singing in a piteous and touching way. 3 Enoch describes the Watchers as holy angels. According to the text, four great princes called “Watchers and holy ones” (the terms used in Daniel) reside in the seventh heaven opposite the throne of glory facing God. They are called Watchers and holy ones because on the third day of judgment (after death), they sanctify the body and soul with lashes of fi re (a reference to preparing the soul for God’s presence). Each Watcher has 70 names corresponding to the 70 languages of the world, and all of them are based on the name of God. Each name is written with a pen of flame on God’s crown. Such sparks and lightning shoot forth from them that no angels, not even the seraphim, can look upon them. The Watchers are praised with the praise of the Shekinah, and God does nothing without taking their counsel. They function as offi cers in the heavenly court and debate and close each case that comes up for judgment. They announce the verdicts, proclaim the sentences, and sometimes go down to Earth to carry out the sentences. A Qumran text called the Testament of Amran (Q543, 545–548), which exists only in several fragments and manuscripts, concerns the Watchers. In Manuscript B Fragment 1, the anonymous author describes a dream vision in which two Watchers are fi ghting over him. He asks, “Who are you that you are thus empowered over me?” They tell him that they have been empowered to rule over all humankind, and they ask him to choose which of them he would want as a ruler. One of them has a terrifying appearance, like a serpent wearing a dark cloak of many colors. He has a “visage like a viper.” Fragment 2 identifi es BELIAL as one of the Watchers.  He has three titles, Belial, Prince of Darkness, and King of Evil, and he is empowered over all darkness and his every way, and every work are darkness. Fragment 3 mentions the “sons of Light,” who are ruled by a being who identifies himself with three names: Michael, Prince of Light, and King of Righteousness. Another fragment says that all the sons of Darkness will be destroyed because of their foolishness and evil and the sons of Light will have eternal joy  and rejoicing for all peace and truth will be made light."

        "name": "Zar",
        "description": "In Muslim lore, a possessing DJINN that usually attacks women and refuses to leave until the victim receives lavish gifts of jewelry, perfume, clothes, and dainty foods. Second-class citizens under male domination, Muslim women rely on the zar to give them some measure of power and privilege. Husbands must provide expensive gifts and sweetmeats to create peace in the household. Such appeasement raises suspicions of manipulation, but so ingrained in Islamic culture is the belief in spirit interference that husbands dare not tempt fate. Descriptions of zar possessions were recorded in the early 19th century by travelers to the Egypt and the Middle East. The “cult of the zar” continues in areas in modern times. The usual POSSESSION and EXORCISM of the zar proceed as follows: The victim, suffering from some minor complaint, blames possession by the zar, and other female relatives prevent her from seeing a medical doctor, preferring the services of an old woman who is a female shaman, a shechah-ez-zar. For a fee, the shechah identifi es a zar as the source of the woman’s troubles and interrogates the zar, sometimes in a recognizable language and sometimes in zar language, understood only by the shechah. After repeated conversations, the zar offers to leave once the possessed victim receives specifi c lavish gifts and attention from her husband. On the afternoon of the zar’s scheduled departure, a “beating the zar” ceremony is performed at the victim’s home. The victim’s female friends and relatives join her for the ceremony, often accompanied by food, coffee, and a flute and drumming performance. The shechah and her assistants chant the fi nal exorcism rites, with music, and then often sacrifi ce a lamb. The lamb’s BLOOD is rubbed on the victim’s forehead and elsewhere. She then dances madly, sways, and fi nally faints. The zar leaves, satisfied that the victim has been rewarded. In some ceremonies, the questioning of the zar is done after the victim and others dance and enter trance. The shechah asks for a remedy to the malady, and the zar specifi es gifts. The ecstatic dancers may be shown silver rings and bracelets and other objects, which pacify the zar. On a day fi xed by the zar, another fi t can occur, which can be relieved only by the satisfying of a wish. Zar exorcisms have become part of contemporary urban Islamic culture. In many large cities, such as Cairo, regular exorcisms are held in a public building as often as once a week. The length of the ceremony, from three to seven nights, depends upon the fee that can be paid. Women from all walks of life participate, whirling and dancing until the spirit leaves them and they return home, exhausted but entertained. Relief from the possession may be only temporary, and it may return with another infraction committed by a husband. Men are expected to believe in the possession, which, in addition to giving women the freedom to ask for gifts, permits them to scold and upbraid their husbands in a manner that would be forbidden under normal circumstances Nineteenth-century accounts of zar possession in Abyssinia describe a different cult that affected men as well as women, blamed on the zar, or bouddha, evil spirit. The victim typically was affl icted in the middle of the night. He would run out, roll on the ground, and scream until exhausted and still. The remedy consisted of taking a hen, swinging it around the head, and smashing it to the ground. If the hen died immediately, it meant the zar had passed into the body of the fowl and the victim was cleared. If the hen survived, the remedy had to be repeated until a bird died."
